during	O

At	O

Infectious	O
Diseases	O
in	O
the	O
Rudolf	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
idea	O
concerning	O
the	O
etiology	O

Since	O
our	O
department	O
was	O
in	O
charge	O
of	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
the	O
sick	O
,	O
we	O
started	O
to	O
consider	O
the	O
hypothesis	O
of	O
an	O
unknown	O

To	O
our	O
own	O

I	O
can	O

from	O
the	O

of	O
some	O

It	O
took	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
until	O
we	O
and	O
our	O
colleagues	O
from	O
the	O
Department	O
of	O
Health	O
found	O
out	O
that	O
the	O
disease	O
was	O
caused	O
by	O
a	O

A	O

It	O
would	O
