 In this update:
 [1] UK Department of Health CJD/BSE Monthly Statistics - October
 [2] Prolonged survival of patient treated with pentosan polysulphate
 The Department of Health issued on Mon 6 Oct 2003 the latest information 
 about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This 
 includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in 
 ProMED-mail as (vCJD) or CJD (new var.)] -- the form of the disease thought 
 to be linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The position is as 
 follows:
 Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
 Referrals of suspect CJD/ Deaths of definite and probable CJD

 Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 3
 Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 137

 The precise definitions of the terms: Referrals, Deaths, Definite cases, 
 Probable vCJD cases, Sporadic, Probable sporadic, Iatrogenic, Familial, 
 GSS, variant CJD, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the 
 Department of Health web-site or by reference to a preceding ProMED-mail 
 post in this thread [CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 200220020305.3693].
 The next monthly statistics will be published on Mon 3 Nov 2003.
 [Since the previous monthly statistics released by the Department of Health 
 on Mon 1 Sep 2003, the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases 
 (dead and alive) has increased by 3, and the number of deaths has increased 
 by one. The number of probable vCJD cases still alive has increased by 
 2.  The death toll continues to rise, but overall the data are not 
 inconsistent with the continued decline in vCJD incidence reported during 
 the preceding 6 months.
 In view of the experimental evidence from transmission experiments in mice 
 reported by Asante et al. (MRC Prion Unit, University College, London) in 
 the EMBO Journal, Vol. 21, No. 23, 6358-6368, 2002 that: "Some patients 
 with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD may have a disease arising 
 from BSE exposure" (see: CJD, possible association with BSE20021129.5921), 
 the figures for sporadic CJD cases now have added significance in relation 
 to the course of the vCJD outbreak and will continued to be presented here.
 <http://emboj.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/23/6358?etoc>
 vCJD has been recognized to date only in individuals homozygous for 
 methionine at PRNP codon 129, and Asante et al. reported that transgenic 
 mice expressing human PrP methionine 129, inoculated with either bovine 
 spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or variant CJD prions, may develop the 
 neuropathological and molecular phenotype of vCJD, consistent with these 
 diseases being caused by the same prion strain. However, BSE transmission 
 to these transgenic mice, in addition to producing a vCJD-like phenotype, 
 also resulted in a distinct molecular phenotype that was indistinguishable 
 from that of sporadic CJD with PrP\Sc type 2. These data suggest that more 
 than one BSE-derived prion strain might infect humans; it is therefore 
 possible that some patients with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD 
 may have a disease arising from BSE exposure.
 Since Mon 1 Sep 2003 the number of deaths attributed to sporadic CJD has 
 increased by 10. - Mod.CP]
 Neurologists have expressed cautious optimism about small improvements and 
 lack of toxicity in a UK teenager with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
 [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD] treated with an 
 experimental drug, pentosan polysulphate. The patient, a 19-year-old male 
 from Belfast, Northern Ireland, has been treated with pentosan polysulphate 
 by injection into the brain since a decision by the High Court during 2002 
 that the potential benefits outweighed the risks (see: BMJ 2003;326).
 Neurologists meeting in Belfast last week to review the early results of 
 treatment considered that the drug seemed to be well tolerated and that it 
 might have improved his condition. After 8 months' treatment, the patient 
 had shown some improvement in neurological functions, including regaining 
 the ability to swallow. His parents claimed that he had become more alert, 
 responding to verbal instructions, and attempting to speak. Monitoring of 
 his heart rhythm showed less variation -� thought to be associated with 
 brain stem damage �- than before starting treatment.
 Nikolai Rainov, of the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, 
 Liverpool, said: "The question of efficacy is still very much open. 
 However, we believe that the brain stem now functions better than it did 6 
 to 8 months ago." He reported: "Some neurological functions have improved 
 significantly over the course of treatment. The patient is even able to 
 obey commands -� something which was not the case 6 months ago." He 
 considered that pentosan polysulphate might have a role in prolonging 
 survival in patients with vCJD and in improving their quality of life. He 
 added: "I believe that instigating treatment at an early stage could 
 achieve significant extension of the life span of these patients."

 [In an additional article in the British Medical Journal (BMJ, vol 125, 4 
 Oct 2003) Susan Mayor wrote the following: "Pentosan polysulphate, the drug 
 used for the last 8 months to treat a UK teenager with variant 
 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), was reviewed by the Committee on the 
 Safety of Medicines last year. In its review (October 2002), the Committee 
 felt unable to recommend its use in vCJD because of the absence of in vitro 
 or in vivo data relevant to vCJD and the lack of information on the basic 
 pharmacology of the drug, including its mode of action in this indication. 
 In particular, the committee considered that it could not recommend the 
 intraventricular infusion of pentosan polyphosphate to be used as a 
 treatment in humans for established vCJD disease. It recommended that the 
 drug should be evaluated in models resembling human disease as closely as 
 possible, including mouse BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and sheep 
 BSE models. The CJD Therapy Advisory Group agreed with this opinion but 
 'acknowledged that healthcare professionals may be more risk averse than 
 patients or their families when considering potential treatments for 
 incurable diseases such as CJD.'"

 Pentosan polysulphate (poly-b-xylose-2,3-disulphonate) is a large 
 polysulphonated polyglycoside. The drug is relatively inexpensive -� made 
 from beechwood -� and has been used since the 1960s as an anticoagulant, in 
 a similar way to heparin, also a polysulphonated polyglycoside. It is 
 currently used in North America for treating interstitial cystitis but is 
 not licensed in the United Kingdom.
 It has not been used previously to treat human vCJD, although animal 
 studies have shown that injecting the drug into the brains of animals 
 infected with scrapie, a disease closely related to CJD, slowed the 
 accumulation of prions -� the infectious particles implicated in 
 transmission and progression of CJD. It has been suggested that pentosan 
 binds to heparan binding sites on infectious prion proteins, potentially 
 inhibiting further prion production. The drug has to be given directly into 
 the brain because it is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier.
