 New Jersey - Suspected Monkeypox Case Not Confirmed; 
 Wisconsin - Person-to-person Transmission In Doubt
 -----------------------------------
 An 11-year-old New Jersey boy who was suspected of having monkeypox does not 
 have the disease -- he has chickenpox, a common childhood ailment, 
 authorities said on Fri 13 Jun 2003.
 The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notified New
 Jersey authorities on the afternoon of Fri 13 Jun 2003 that genetic tests on
 the child came back negative for monkeypox. The child was suspected to have
 been exposed to monkeypox through contact with prairie dogs in Indiana, New
 Jersey Health and Senior Services Commissioner Clifton R. Lacy said. There
 are no other suspected monkeypox cases in New Jersey.
 Meanwhile, initial reports of the first human-to-human transmissions of 
 monkeypox virus to Wisconsin health care workers now seem unlikely, state 
 health officials said on Friday. An assessment of the symptoms shown by the 2 
 health care workers, who both had contact with known monkeypox patients, do 
 not appear to fit the viral illness, said Dr. Jeff Davis, the state 
 epidemiologist for communicable diseases.
 U.S. health officials have confirmed a total of 12 human cases of monkeypox: 
 4 each in Wisconsin, Indiana and Illinois. Also, 53 possible cases had been 
 reported: 25 in Indiana, 17 in Wisconsin & 11 in Illinois. No one has died 
 from the disease in the United States. Monkeypox, a disease never before seen 
 in the Western Hemisphere, is related to smallpox but is not as lethal. It 
 causes pus-filled blisters, rashes, chills and fever.
 A shipment of animals believed to have spread monkeypox has been traced to a
 pet-distribution center in Iowa, health officials said. Evelee Prokes, owner
 of the Menagerie Hill Farm in Cincinnati, Iowa, said her pet-breeding and
 distribution business was shut amid a probe by CDC and state health
 officials. Disease trackers are checking a shipment of African rats that may
 have been infected with monkeypox when they passed through the center.
 [Monkeypox and chickenpox are caused by unrelated viruses. The etiologic 
 agent of monkey pox is _monkeypox virus_ which is related to _smallpox 
 virus_, and which is classified in the _Orthopoxvirus_ genus of poxviruses. 
 The etiologic agent of chickenpox is _Human herpesvirus 3_ (previously known 
 as varicella virus), a member of the subfamily _Alphaherpesvirinae_ of 
 herpesviruses. The diseases associated with these viruses have similarities, 
 and as noted previously in ProMED-mail (see: Monkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) 
 (06)20020410.3926) have been confused in the past in outbreaks of illness in 
 West/Central Africa. - Mod.CP]
