 I was one of the team that evaluated and cared for the 43 Marines and 
 Sailors  who were med-evaced from Liberia to Bethesda Naval Hospital.  [I am  
 responding] to the query about why no Marines were using bednets while in 
 Liberia. Bednet use is a part of the standard Navy/Marine Corps procedures 
 for malaria prevention.  The Marines deploying to Liberia had bednets back 
 on their ship. The decision not to go ashore with bednets was multifactorial:
 1. Operational considerations (essentially fast in and fast out with as 
 little equipment as possible) made bringing cots, poles, and bednets 
 difficult.
 2. The initial plan was only for 1-3 nights, not 10-12 nights
 3. Marines were staying in an old airport building with a hard floor, not 
 the ideal setup for use of bednets with poles that need to be driven into 
 the ground.
 A review of the situation leading to this outbreak addressed the lack of 
 bednet use as a significant factor in development of these cases. A newly 
 developed, easily folded, easily deployed bednet with a floor was 
 demonstrated, and is in the process of coming into the Department of Defense 
 supply system for future deployments.
 [Impregnated bednets have a protective efficacy of around 50 percent if 
 used properly. The reason for not finding higher efficacy is that the net 
 provides protection only while the individual is sleeping under it. Thus 
 there is exposure to mosquitoes early in the morning and in the evening 
 before going to bed, and soldiers on night duty will not be protected. The 
 use of nets in the given situation would therefore have reduced the number 
 of cases, but probably by less than half. Under intense transmission as in 
 this situation, chemoprophylaxis provides better protection than 
 impregnated bednets. - Mod.EP]
 [But another response, from a former Marine, highlights the problem of poor 
 compliance with prophylaxis among the military.  In such circumstances, any 
 reduction in illness among active duty troops provided by impregnated bednets 
 is operationally important. It is good to hear that the experience of this 
 outbreak has led to immediate modification of bednet design.  I suppose 
 neither Marines nor Sailors sleep in hammocks any more, but the jungle 
 hammock with integral bednet is a very practical design, & could be readily 
 rigged inside buildings on the light dismountable tubing frames used for 
 garden hammocks, probably no heavier in total weight than camp cots. - Mod.JW]
