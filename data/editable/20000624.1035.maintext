 Regarding information sent by Carla Everett on viral hemorrhagic disease of
 rabbits, [see ProMED-mail Announcements 2000 (22) cited above] a correction
 needs to be made.  Dr. Alfonso Torres is a very well informed USDA officer
 so I think there must be an error of interpretation.     
 This deadly disease of rabbits [rabbit hemorrhagic disease]  was introduced
 to Mexico in 1988 and epidemiologic investigations at that time indicated
 that the origin of the infection was a shipment of rabbit meat originating
 in China and introduced to Mexico via the United States of America.  The
 disease was eradicated from Mexico around 1992 and to my knowledge Mexico
 is the only country were this disease has been eradicated.     
 So after that many years after its eradication from Mexico, there is no
 possible chance that the recent infection in the United States of America
 "may have entered the US through Mexico".

 [What Dr. Torres was quoted as saying was that "the disease was discovered
 in l984 in China, and as infection spread, the disease may have entered the
 US through Mexico".  He did not say that the disease had recently entered
 the U.S. from Mexico.  The source of the virus causing the recent outbreak
 in Iowa is still unknown. - Mod.CHC]
