 Regarding the domoic acid toxicosis event in the Pacific Ocean off [the 
 coast of] California this past spring, to date we have been unable to 
 verify classic histopathologic lesions of domoic acid toxicosis in dolphin 
 brains.
 In most mammals, the hippocampus is fairly large and well-developed.  The 
 classic lesion of domoic acid (and other excitotoxins) toxicosis is 
 necrosis of the hippocampal neurons.  We have seen this lesion many times 
 before in affected sea lions, as well as in experimental studies on rodents.
 In dolphins and other cetaceans, the hippocampus is extremely small (less 
 than 1/4 cm in diameter in dolphins) and poorly developed.  The distinctive 
 histologic layered arrangement is indistinct, so it is very hard to locate 
 and identify on histologic sections. It lies at the base of the brain, near 
 the ventral surface of the temporal lobes, just lateral to the optic 
 chiasm, in an area that is easily damaged if the brain is autolysed or is 
 not removed with the utmost care.  Most of the dolphin brain tissues 
 submitted to us during this outbreak were either small pieces of brain 
 tissue, or whole brains cut with multiple parallel longitudinal cuts 
 ("bread loafed"), making the location of this small structure impossible.
 In our search for the hippocampus, we have enlisted the help of Department 
 of Neuropathology and the curator of the Yakovlev-Haleem Comparative Brain 
 Anatomy collection, with its fine-quality archived dolphin brain 
 specimens.  After several months of effort and many, many slides, last week 
 we finally got good sections of hippocampus from 2 brains, one domoic acid 
 suspect (no neuronal necrosis found), and one control animal from the 
 Atlantic ocean.
 Although reports from California indicate this outbreak seems to be over, 
 it will be important in any future events to submit any dolphin brains 
 intact, fixed whole by immersion in formalin, with no "breadloafing."  Any 
 sectioning of the brain before fixation severely hampers our ability to 
 locate the hippocampus.
 Domoic acid may have caused the deaths of these animals. Multiple dolphins 
 had high levels of domoic acid in the urine, stomach contents, or amniotic 
 fluid, and some have been observed seizuring.  However, we have found some 
 nonspecific inflammation in a few of these brains, which may have caused 
 the seizures, and the mere presence of a toxin does not necessarily mean it 
 is causing disease.  Without the classic demonstrable brain lesion, we have 
 so far been unable to support the presumptive diagnosis.
 [ProMED-mail is grateful for the follow-up! Accurate histopathological 
 diagnosis is important, but it starts with a properly prepared specimen. 
 This is an excellent reminder of the proper method of specimen submission 
 in cases of suspected domoic acid toxicosis. - Mod.TG]
