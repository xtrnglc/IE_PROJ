 Another 2 separated outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) have been 
 identified in villages named Kashempur and Woalia in Savar Upazila, 40 km 
 from the capital city of Dhaka.
 More than 20 animals were infected and samples collected from them showed 
 the presence of FMD. Samples have been examined by ELISA. One of the 
 infected calves (8 days old) has died from infection, and virus (serotype 
 O) was also identified from the dead calf.
 Investigation showed the presence of new animals introduced for Eid-ul Azha 
 was responsible for the introduction of virus into the outbreak areas.
