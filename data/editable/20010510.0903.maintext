 EU to Resume Uruguayan Beef Imports
 -----------------------------------------------
 .
 President Jorge Batlle said the European Union will resume importing beef 
 from Uruguay after a foot-and-mouth vaccination program ends at the end of 
 the month.
 The EU banned meat imports from Uruguay last month after a foot-and-mouth 
 disease (FMD) outbreak affected cattle in 16 of the country's 19 counties. 
 At least 190 cases were reported.
 Earlier this month, Uruguay began vaccinating its entire herd of 10 million 
 cattle, a program scheduled to end 24 May 2001.
