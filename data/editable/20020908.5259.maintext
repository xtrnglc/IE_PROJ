 Two people have died of dengue -- one in the city and the other in Sherpur 
 -- while 81 others have been admitted to hospital in the city and elsewhere 
 in the country in the last 2 days.
 One of the victims, 12 years old, died of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in 
 a private clinic in the city at 8:30pm Saturday, doctors at the clinic 
 said. The victim in Sherpur district, 15 years old, died of DHF due to 
 profuse bleeding at 12 noon Saturday.
 Of the 81 newly hospitalised dengue patients, 18 were admitted to Dhaka 
 Medical College Hospital, 6 to Mitford Hospital, and 13 to Holy Family Red 
 Crescent Hospital. Another 14 dengue patients were hospitalised in BIRDEM 
 and Government Employee's Hospital in the city, as well as in hospitals in 
 Barisal and Chittagong; 30 people with DHF, some of them in critical 
 condition, were admitted to different private clinics in the city.
 So far, the number of deaths from dengue this year is 41, while 3747 dengue 
 patients have been hospitalised, according to official report.
 The Department of Epidemiological Surveillance of the Ministry of Health 
 reports that so far this year [2002] there have been about 4435 cases of 
 dengue, including 11 cases of DHF.
 According to studies by the Costa Rican Institute of Research & Training in 
 Nutrition & Health (INCIENSA), Costa Ricans are now exposed to 2 serotypes 
 of dengue. Type 1 has been absent from the country since the year 2000, but 
 has reappeared.
 Minister of Health Maria del Rocio Saenz explained that when a person has 
 been infected by one serotype of dengue, they remain immune for life; but 
 if such a person catches a different strain, then the chances of suffering 
 from DHF are increased.
