 The outbreak of _P.vivax_ malaria in Queensland resolved
 ---------------------------------
 .
 An outbreak of _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria at a campsite in Northern 
 Queensland has affected 10 people including 3 overseas visitors (one from 
 Ireland, one from Germany, and one from Canada). The outbreak occurred 
 during the first 2 weeks of October 2002 among tourists staying at the Noah 
 Beach campsite, which is a campsite in Daintree National Park, Cape 
 Tribulation. Park rangers have used details from self-registration forms at 
 the campsite to compile a list of visitors to Noah Beach during the period 
 of malaria transmission. Where contact details were available, the Tropical 
 Public Health Unit in Queensland contacted individuals to inform them of 
 the occurrence of malaria and offer advice. Visitors to the park have 
 included travellers from the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Italy, Israel, 
 the Netherlands, and Sweden (Dianne Brookes 
 (Dianne_Brookes@health.qld.gov.au), Tropical Public Health Unit, 
 Queensland, personal communication, 12 Nov 2002).
 The individual believed to be the source of the outbreak stayed at the 
 campsite in late September 2002 for 4 days. He had travelled to Indonesia 
 in 2001, to Africa in 2002, and was diagnosed with _Plasmodium vivax_ 
 malaria the day after he left the campsite. Local mosquitoes may have 
 become infectious from around 8 Oct 2002 (1). Mosquito trapping revealed a 
 large number of _Anopheles farauti_, which can transmit malaria in Northern 
 Queensland, breeding in 2 creeks on either side of the campsite. If, as is 
 assumed, there are no further human cases to act as a reservoir, then it is 
 unlikely that further infectious mosquitoes remain at the campsite, because 
 of their short lifespan (Jeffrey Hanna, communication with ProMED-mail, 1 
 Nov 2002, accessed on, 2 Nov 2002). Visitors rarely 
 stay at the campsite for more than 2 or 3 nights, and so the presence of a 
 human reservoir is unlikely to be sustained. This, together with other 
 considerations, may explain why there has not been a larger outbreak.
 Australia was declared malaria-free in 1981 (2). Imported cases, however, 
 have occasionally led to authochthonous transmission. A similar outbreak of 
 _Pl. vivax_ involving 5 cases occurred in the Cape Tribulation area in 
 1986; the source was believed to be a man who had arrived from the Solomon 
 Islands and spent a week in Cape Tribulation before going onto Brisbane. He 
 was diagnosed with _Pl. vivax_ infection in November 1986 (3).
 _Pl. vivax_ infection is prostrating, but rarely life-threatening. After a 
 primary infection following an _Anopheles_ mosquito bite, hypnozoites may 
 remain dormant in the liver cells and can be reactivated many months later, 
 causing a further symptomatic attack (relapse). Health professionals are 
 reminded to take a full travel history in those who present with an 
 unexplained flu-like illness or fever. They should consider malaria in the 
 differential diagnosis in any patients who present with these symptoms 
 within the next year, and who may have stayed at the Noah Beach campsite in 
 October 2002.
