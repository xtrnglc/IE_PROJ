 The independent (read unofficial) press agency Union of Independent Cuban 
 Journalists and Writers has reported 14 cases of malaria in Havana. The 
 report can be found at
 <http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y01/mar01/13a1.htm>.
 There has been no confirmation of malaria from any official source. In the 
 past, disease outbreaks in Cuba have not been reported by the government. 
 The Boletin Epidemiologico (Vol.10 No.52/2000) of the Instituto Pedro Kouri 
 reported a total of 36 imported cases of malaria in 2000, but mentioned no 
 non-imported malaria cases.
 [The original Spanish report does not say whether the cases were 
 autochthonous or imported. Although they were in a very poor part of the 
 capital, where you might not expect to find tourists who had recently 
 travelled to Africa, there may be soldiers living there who had returned 
 from Africa, or workers who had visited Nicaragua or other such countries.
