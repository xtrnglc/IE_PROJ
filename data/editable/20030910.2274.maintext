 Saskatchewan: Donated Blood Withdrawn in Response to Rise in West Nile Cases

 In this update:
 [1] Blood donations withdrawn (Saskatchewan)
 [2] Health Canada Surveillance Data (As of Tue 9 Sep 2003)
 Donated blood from Saskatchewan is being withdrawn from hospitals across 
 Canada in response to the latest jump in West Nile cases in the province. 
 On Wed 3 Sep 2003, Canadian Blood Services announced it would recall all 
 blood components collected in Saskatchewan between 4 Aug and 31 Aug 2003. 
 At the same time, health officials were seeking to reassure the public that 
 people who have received blood products recently have little to worry 
 about. "Those patients that have received (blood) in the last month, I 
 don't think have to take any additional steps or have reason to be 
 concerned," said Dr. Ted Alport, the medical director for Blood Services in 
 Saskatchewan.
 To create an extra layer of safety, the national blood agency is also 
 moving to a new system of testing Saskatchewan blood donations for the 
 virus, switching from testing blood samples in pools of 6 to individual 
 testing, Alport said. "We know in theory because we're not diluting the 
 sample it has the potential to be safer," Alport said. The agency plans to 
 go back to pooled testing after the West Nile outbreak subsides.
 About 4000 units of blood were collected in Saskatchewan since 4 Aug 2003, 
 but it's not yet known how much has already been used. Of the 12 blood 
 donations identified as containing West Nile virus since July, 8 were from 
 Saskatchewan. As the Saskatchewan blood is removed from hospitals, CBS will 
 replace it with frozen product collected before 1 Jun 2003, when there were 
 no West Nile cases. Alport said despite the recall, Canadian Blood Services 
 will continue to collect blood in Saskatchewan. It's important that 
 residents continue to donate, he said. "As much as ever, we need donors."
 Because of Saskatchewan's relatively small population, the loss of a 
 month's worth of donated blood won't have a major impact on the national 
 blood supply, Alport said. The recalled blood will be fractionated, a 
 process that separates blood into its constituent parts, but also kills the 
 West Nile virus. On Wed 3 Sep 2003, the Saskatchewan Health Department said 
 the number of confirmed and suspected West Nile virus cases has risen to 97 
 [now 113], the highest of any province.

 As of Tue 9 Sep 2003 there have been a total of 232 probable or confirmed 
 cases of human infection in Canada, Saskatchewan being the most severely 
 affected province with 113 probable or confirmed cases, closely followed by 
 Alberta with 86 probable or confirmed cases:
 Province/No. probable cases/No. confirmed cases/No. of deaths
 Nova Scotia / 1 / 0 / 0
 Quebec / 1 / 0 / 0
 Ontario / 19 / 1 / 0
 Manitoba / 8 / 2/ 0
 Saskatchewan / 103 / 10 / 0
 Alberta / 79 / 7 / 0
 British Columbia 1 / 0 / 0
 Total 212 / 20 / 0
 [The probable case in Nova Scotia is considered to be travel-related and 
 not an indigenous case; see: West Nile virus, human - Canada (Nova Scotia) 
 ex USA20030825.2145.  Since the last update on Wed 3 Aug 2003 the number 
 of probable or confirmed cases from 131 to 232. In all, 78.5 percent 
 (182/232) of the cases have occurred in the prairie province of 
 Saskatchewan and Alberta. Single cases have been reported from Quebec and 
 British Columbia for the first time. The case in British Columbia is 
 thought to have contracted infection while travelling in the USA. 2 deaths 
 that do not appear in the Health Canada statistics have been reported in 
 ProMED-mail post: West Nile virus, human - Canada (Quebec): 
 suspected20030908.2250.
 In 2002, there were 416 probable or confirmed cases of human West Nile 
 virus infection in Canada and 21 deaths attributed to the virus. All the 
 deaths and most of the cases occurred in Ontario and Quebec, in contrast to 
 the situation in 2003, when few cases have been reported from Ontario and 
 none from Quebec.
 Dr. Charles Chambers <cchambers@cdc.gov> has pointed out that there is an 
 arithmetical error in the figures for human cases reproduced from the Heath 
 Canada web-site and included in the update of Wed 3 Sep 2003. These figures 
 were later revised on the Health Canada web-site, but the total number of 
 cases remains the same. ProMED-mail is indebted to Dr. Chambers for 
 detecting the error. - Mod.CP]
 As of Tue 9 Sep 2003, 186 presumptive or confirmed equine cases have been 
 reported; Quebec (4), Ontario (16), Manitoba (29), Saskatchewan (78), 
 Alberta (59).
 [The number of presumptive or confirmed equine cases of West Nile virus 
 infection has increased by 101 since Wed 3 Sep 2003. In all, 93 percent 
 (94/101) new cases have been reported from the prairie provinces of 
 Saskatchewan and Alberta. - Mod.CP]
 As of Tue 9 Sep 2003, 338 pools of mosquitoes have tested positive; Quebec 
 (39), Ontario (53), Manitoba (196), Saskatchewan (19, Alberta (31).
 [This represents an increase of 137 West Nile virus-positive mosquito pools 
 since Wed 3 Sep 2003.  In contrast to the data for other animals, the 
 greatest increase (85.4 percent) was observed in Manitoba. - Mod.CP]
 As of Tue 9 Sep 2003, the following test results by Province have been 
 reported:
 Province/ No. submitted for testing/ No.tested/ No. confirmed positive /
 Newfoundland and Labrador/ 68 / 63/ 0 /
 Prince Edward Island/ 253 / 236 / 0 /
 Nova Scotia/ 770 / 730 / 2 /

 *Note that in the Ontario count, after the 4th confirmed positive bird, no 
 further testing is carried out and the birds are listed as presumed positive.
 [The totals for Canada for 2003 so far are 10 810 birds submitted for 
 testing, 9981 birds tested, and 959 confirmed West Nile virus-positive. In 
 addition there were 3010 sightings of dead birds recorded. This represents 
 an increase of 322 birds tested and 117 more birds confirmed positive since 
 the last update on Wed 3 Sep 2003. There has been no extension of range. -
