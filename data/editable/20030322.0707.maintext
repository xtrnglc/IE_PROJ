 Update #6 - severe acute respiratory syndrome
 ---------------------------------------------
 .
 As of 21 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 9 individuals who 
 have become ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario 
 and British Columbia. These cases have either recently traveled to Hong 
 Kong or have had close contact with these individuals. The details of the 
 cases to date are as follows:
 Ontario: In a single family, 3 people have been admitted to hospital with 
 severe pneumonia of unknown cause, 2 other members have died. In addition, 
 individuals (2) with close contact with this family have been admitted to 
 hospital. Also in Ontario, a separate, unrelated case who had traveled 
 recently to Hong Kong has also been admitted to hospital.
 British Columbia: one person has been admitted to hospital with SARS.
 At this time, the cause of SARS remains unknown, but national and 
 international laboratory testing and collaboration is ongoing. Here are the 
 most recent developments:
 Scientists at Health Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg 
 report that they have found evidence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 
 specimens from 6 of the 8 cases they are studying. The metapneumovirus is 
 part of paramyxoviridae family. These findings are consistent with the 
 results previously released by scientists in Germany and Hong Kong.
 The findings of the National Microbiology Laboratory are significant in 
 that a common thread has been found in a majority of cases in Canada. This 
 is a promising step in the investigation. Scientists will continue their 
 work to try to verify the findings and to determine if there are other 
 factors involved that are influencing the severity of this outbreak.
 Paramyxoviruses can be responsible for mumps, measles, pneumonia and the 
 common cold. The metapneumovirus was only recently identified in humans. It 
 causes respiratory symptoms that are not usually as severe as those seen in 
 the current outbreak. To date no antiviral medications have been developed 
 specifically to treat metapneumovirus. These findings will not likely alter 
 the current treatment for SARS patients.
 Health Canada has initiated the following activities:
 We have expanded health alert card distribution at major airports in 
 Canada. In addition to Pearson and Vancouver, these cards are being 
 distributed at all airports that receive international flights from all 
 destinations other than the United States.
 Health Canada issued revised travel advice on 19 Mar 2003. The overall risk 
 for travelers appears to be low at this time. However, because of recent 
 increases in cases of SARS in the city of Hanoi, Vietnam, Hong Kong Special 
 Administrative Region, and Singapore and that transmission may not be 
 limited to the hospital setting, Health Canada advises that people planning 
 elective or nonessential travel to the city of Hanoi, Vietnam, Hong Kong 
 Special Administrative Region, and Singapore may wish to postpone their 
 trips until further notice.
 In collaboration with the provinces, territories, and local health units, 
 Health Canada has begun enhanced surveillance for the recognition of SARS 
 cases. Health Canada has also asked officials at the Pearson and Vancouver 
 International Airports to carefully monitor passengers arriving from Hong 
 Kong and Singapore to see if anyone has flu-like symptoms. Health Canada 
 has sent staff to Pearson and Vancouver International Airports to support 
 airport staff. Health professionals have been sent to each airport to help 
 monitor passengers arriving on direct flights from Hong Kong and Singapore 
 for flu-like symptoms and to assist those who appear to be ill. They have 
 started distributing Health Alert Notices to all passengers arriving in or 
 returning from Hong Kong and Singapore which will ask passengers to see a 
 physician if they begin to have any symptoms related to SARS. These 
 symptoms include a fever over 38.0 degrees Celsius AND one or more of the 
 following respiratory symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty 
 breathing.
 Health Canada's Workplace Health and Public Safety Programme is providing 
 advice to federal employers on occupational health and safety matters. 
 Health professionals from Health Canada's Workplace Health and Public 
 Safety Programme were on site at the Pearson and Vancouver airports to 
 provide information sessions for federal employees. They are available, at 
 the employer's request, to provide sessions for federal employees at all 
 airports that receive international flights from all destinations other 
 than the United States. The Workplace Health and Safety Programme has 
 issued an advisory notice and has spoken to or met with representatives of 
 a number of federal departments to provide them with information and advice 
 they can use in determining what health and safety measures they deem 
 appropriate for their employees. It is Health Canada's position that 
 Government of Canada workers are not considered to be at high risk of 
 infection because of the limited contact with and proximity to the 
 individuals. Therefore, Health Canada advises that the use of masks is not 
 necessary. Health Canada continues to provide employer departments with the 
 most current information and advice available on SARS.
 Health Canada will continue to do everything it can to keep Canadians 
 informed and will continue to work with the provinces and territories so 
 that medical officers are fully informed and appropriate steps are taken to 
 mitigate risk. For additional information on SARS, please contact Health 
 Canada's information line at: 1-800-454-8302. For information on previous 
 travel advisories to South East Asia issued by Health Canada and the World 
 Health Organization, please see the following links:

 [The laboratory results continue to point the finger towards a member of 
 the paramyxovirus family. In the above release from Health Canada, they 
 have identified the virus as a human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a "newer" 
 member of the paramyxovirus family. One of the earlier descriptions of the 
 hMPV (van den Hoogen BG, et al. A newly discovered human pneumovirus 
 isolated from young children with respiratory tract disease. Nat Med 2001; 
 7(6): 719-24) was reported in ProMED-mail (Paramyxoviruses, new human 
 pathogen - Netherlands20010603.1094). All of these results are suggesting 
 more and more that the paramxyovirus family may be the etiology of SARS. -
