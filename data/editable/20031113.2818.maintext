 Pennsylvania: Beaver County Hepatitis Probe Changes Focus
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 Health officials now believe that contaminated food delivered to a Beaver 
 County restaurant is a more likely cause of the ongoing hepatitis A 
 outbreak than poor worker hygiene as originally suspected. Investigators 
 are also considering whether the problem at the Chi-Chi's restaurant at 
 Beaver Valley Mall is related to recent hepatitis A outbreaks in Georgia 
 and Tennessee, which are being blamed on contaminated green onions.
 The number of cases, which rose to 340 yesterday, forced investigators to 
 reconsider the worker-hygiene theory, said Richard McGarvey, spokesman for 
 the state Department of Health. The new thinking also coincided with the 
 arrival this past weekend of investigators from the Centers for Disease 
 Control and Prevention, which investigated the outbreaks in the other states.
 In Georgia, about 250 people came down with hepatitis A in September and 
 October 2003 after eating at about 12 restaurants in the central and 
 northern parts of the state, said Richard Quartarone, spokesman for the 
 state's health department. In Knoxville, Tennessee, 80 people became ill 
 with hepatitis A in September after eating at one city restaurant, said 
 Mark Jones, director of the Knox County Health Department.
 Contaminated green onions are the prime suspects in both states. "Because 
 they're multi-layered, green onions are very difficult to clean," 
 Quartarone said. "The only way to be 100 percent sure that you killed the 
 hepatitis [virus] in green onions is to cook them. But they're often used 
 as a garnish, so you don't cook them."
 McGarvey cautioned that investigators have not concluded that green onions 
 are the prime suspect here. "We're focusing more on some product that came 
 through here, some ingredient that was possibly contaminated before a food 
 handler could have contaminated it," he said. "Can I say what product at 
 this point? No."
 A confounding factor in the Pennsylvania investigation is that one victim 
 apparently was exposed to hepatitis A around 20 Sep 2003, more than a week 
 before most others were exposed, McGarvey said. If that individual was a 
 restaurant employee, it might suggest the worker caused the problem, but 
 that's not the case, he said. All of the workers -- 11 as of yesterday -- 
 with confirmed hepatitis cases were apparently exposed during the first 
 week of October.
 Dr. Bruce Dixon, director of the Allegheny County Health Department, said a 
 food item such as green onions might be contaminated at one restaurant but 
 not others in a community, because of the way restaurants buy perishables. 
 "It may be that there are different lots and only one lot was 
 contaminated," said Dixon, who is not involved in the investigation. 
 "That's the real concern with the whole scenario. You're going to have to 
 say it was a different lot than what someone else got, or it was only a 
 certain box or quantity that got contaminated."

 The toll of those infected by a hepatitis A outbreak at a restaurant 
 climbed to 410 on Thu 13 Nov 2003, as state health officials continued to 
 interview each victim for clues about how the virus spread. Those infected 
 are being interviewed individually by Health Department officials about 
 when, what and how much they ate at a Chi-Chi's restaurant in the Beaver 
 Valley Mall that's believed to be the source of the sickness. Because 
 officials can't pinpoint the cause, Louisville, Kentucky-based Chi-Chi's 
 has agreed to keep the restaurant closed until 2 Jan 2004 -� 2 months after 
 the restaurant voluntarily closed after the initial reports of the disease.
 Through Thu 13 Nov 2003, 31 people infected were known to be from Ohio, 8 
 from West Virginia, one from Florida, and one from South Carolina. Although 
 not all 410 had been interviewed, the rest of those who had been were from 
 Pennsylvania �- including 280 from Beaver County, said Health Department 
 spokesman Richard McGarvey.
 McGarvey said the only real anomaly at this point is one person who 
 reported being infected after eating at the restaurant 20 Sep 2003 -� 8 
 days before any of the other cases. Infectious disease experts say finding 
 the source of the outbreak can be challenging because hepatitis A has a 
 long incubation period, meaning the virus could be spread to many places 
 before it's detected. Pennsylvania health officials didn't begin warning 
 the public until 3 Nov 2003.
