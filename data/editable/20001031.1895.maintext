 UK Government: Another area free from classical swine fever
 ------------------------------------------
 .
 A second infected area in East Anglia was declared free from classical
 swine fever (CSF) today and the relevant Infected Area Order has been
 revoked. 
 Pigs can now be freely moved on and off about 160 farms previously in the
 Infected Area imposed around the Norfolk breeding unit where the outbreak
 is believed to have originated. It had been confirmed as infected on 9
 August - the second of 15 premises to be confirmed with CSF following the
 start of the outbreak on 8 Aug 2000. 
 The infected area in north Essex was the first to be pronounced clear of
 the disease, and movement restrictions lifted on more than 90 farms
 there, on 22 Sep 2000. 
 The decision to lift the infected area was made following full veterinary
 investigation. Similar investigations will be progressively undertaken in
 the other infected areas with a view to lifting them as soon as possible.
 Notes for Editors 
 1. Farmers in the remaining infected areas who have animal welfare
 problems because of overstocking may apply for a licence to move pigs
 within the same surveillance zone of an infected area, subject to strict 
 conditions. They can also apply to send pigs to slaughter under the Pig
 Disposal (Welfare) Scheme. Details of both options are available from the
 Bury St Edmunds control center helpline on 08702 414215. Farmers in
 infected  areas can also phone this number for general information
 relating to the  outbreak of CSF. 
 2. An EU ban on the export of live pigs and pig semen from Norfolk and
 Suffolk remains in place until November 15. It will be reconsidered at 
 the next meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee of the EU.
