 Question from a correspondent
 -----------------------------
 .
 I'm an interested lay person with a question. In the ProMED-mail post 
 entitled: Norwalk-like virus, cruise ship - USA (FL) (11) it is stated 
 that: " Passengers on the Oceana began reporting classic symptoms of 
 Norwalk virus infection... ...within hours of the ship setting sail." I 
 don't know what the incubation period is for this illness, but has anyone 
 looked at the possibility that the exposure to this illness is occurring at 
 one or more hotels in the vicinity of these ports where passengers are 
 lodging prior to boarding ship?
 [All the passengers on the Oceana were from the United Kingdom, and all the 
 sick passengers had flown to Florida on the same charter flight. As some of 
 the passengers became ill during the first day of the cruise it is likely 
 that they were exposed to the virus prior to boarding the ship, either en 
 route or in Florida prior to embarkation. These circumstances should enable 
 those investigating these outbreaks to provide an answer to the 
 correspondent's question - Mod.CP]
