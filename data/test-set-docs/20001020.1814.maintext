 Ebola haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak in Uganda - WHO Update 4
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 .
 The Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported 122 cases and 47 deaths. As
 reported to WHO on 16 Oct 2000 by the WHO Collaborating Centre, the National
 Institute for Virology (NIV) in South Africa, test results had confirmed
 that Ebola virus was cause of the disease. NIV has now characterized the
 virus strain as similar to, but not identical to Ebola-Sudan.
 The Ebola-Sudan strain [subtype] of Ebola virus was associated with a
 case-fatality rate of between 50-70% in disease outbreaks in southern Sudan
 in 1976 and 1979. This strain [subtype] appears to be somewhat less virulent
 than the Ebola-Zaire strain [subtype], which has caused epidemics in the
 Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), and Gabon with a
 case-fatality rate of between 70-90%.
 Both Ebola strains [subtypes] and the [less] closely-related Marburg virus
 are found in the central region of Africa. While this is the first
 recognized outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) in Uganda, it is
 possible that the strain from the present outbreak has been in Uganda for
 some time.
 Infection control and case management in Gulu district are continuing. A
 Community Alert System has been established for actively seeking cases and
 tracing contacts. Health education messages are also being widely
 disseminated and public health awareness about EHF has greatly increased in
 the community. Mobile teams of epidemiologists and trained health care
 workers are investigating all suspected cases reported to the Operations
 Centre in Gulu and are transporting persons who meet the case definition for
 the disease to one of the two hospital isolation units. These mobile teams
 are also tracing contacts of cases. Control efforts are progressing well. At
 present, the measures taken in the hospital isolation wards make it unlikely
 that any virus transmission will occur in this setting. Many of the sick
 persons and their contacts in the community have been identified and are
 receiving appropriate care. However, new cases are likely to occur in
 persons who may have been infected but who have not yet become ill, and who
 have not yet been identified by public health authorities.
