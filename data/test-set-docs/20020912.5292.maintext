 Ontario: 5 Horses Confirmed West Nile Virus-positive
 -------------------------------------------------------
 .
 As of Thu 12 Sep 2002, West Nile virus (WNV) has been diagnosed in 5 horses 
 by positive immunohistochemistry at the Animal Health Laboratory, 
 University of Guelph. One of these has been confirmed by PCR, the other 4 
 are pending. 2 other suspect cases have been diagnosed by IgM capture ELISA 
 (one horse was euthanised, the other has recovered). The 7 cases to date 
 have all been diagnosed since 28 Aug 2002 and are from various locations in 
 southern Ontario from the Toronto area westward.
 Obtaining accurate case numbers for Ontario is problematic. Since WNV is 
 not a reportable disease, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is not 
 offering diagnostic testing on equine submissions, nor are they compiling 
 statistics on equine cases. PCR confirmatory testing is being done through 
 the Manitoba provincial diagnostic laboratory. Serology is being sent out 
 to Cornell through the Animal Health Laboratory in Guelph, although some 
 veterinarians are sending sera directly to Cornell or Michigan State. In 
 these cases, results are not reported directly to Ontario Ministry of 
 Agriculture and Food and are not included in the statistics. There have 
 been many reports of suspected cases, based on clinical signs or single 
 serology test results. However, unless they are accompanied by valid 
 diagnostic test results to distinguish them from other causes of neurologic 
 disease (e.g. rabies, eastern equine encephalitis), they do not meet the 
 case definition for official reporting.
