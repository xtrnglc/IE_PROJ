 The health authorities of Aracatuba [Sao Paulo state] are issuing an alert 
 about an epidemic of human visceral leishmaniasis in 30 municipalities of 
 the region. In 2002, epidemiological surveillance reported 43 cases in 
 humans resulting in 4 deaths; there were also 2 deaths in 2001. These 
 deaths have led to the development of a strategic plan for disease control 
 by the Superintendence of Endemic Disease Control (Sucen).
 As of Friday [10 Jan 2003], the Epidemiological Surveillance Unit confirmed 
 the first death this year [2003] attributable to visceral leishmaniasis, 
 signifying the 11th death due to this disease since its reappearance in the 
 region in the summer of 1998. The most recent death [2003] is in an adult male.
 The Epidemiological Surveillance Unit will investigate whether the death 
 was due to leishmaniasis or whether the disease was aggravated by an 
 underlying chronic cirrhosis (liver disease). Most cases have been in 
 children, especially those living in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods, due 
 to underlying malnutrition and an association with other diseases such as 
 pneumonia.
 Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the protozoan _Leishmania_ spp. and is 
 transmitted by sand flies, which preferentially feed on dogs. For this 
 reason, disease control is primarily directed at the canine population. 
 Sucen is testing a type of collar with a mosquito repellant. About 10 000 
 dogs have been registered [by census] and are followed in Andradina, and 
 another 2000 in Aracatuba.

 [The species of leishmania implicated is _L.chagasi_ and the vectors are 
 _Lutzomyia_ spp. The animal reservoir includes dogs, foxes, and opossums. 
 In 1999, 3892 human cases were reported in Brazil, 3200 of which were in 
 the north eastern states (www.gideon.com), but the prevalence in Sao Paulo 
 state is not known. Leishmania is one of the infections that increase 
 following an increase in HIV prevalence. - Mod.EP]
