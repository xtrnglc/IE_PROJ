 Rabies kills northern Virginia man
 -------------------------
 .
 A northern Virginia man is dead from rabies, the state's first fatal 
 case in nearly 5 years. The man died in mid-March 2003, but the 
 diagnosis wasn't confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control until 
 this week.
 The Virginia Department of Health won't say exactly where in 
 northern Virginia the man was from, or give the precise date of 
 death [or whether the suspected source was canine or bat bite? - 
 Mod.JW]. Spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell says health officials are 
 now working with people who'd been in close contact with him. 
 They're also trying to figure out how he got rabies, which Caldwell 
 says a person can have and not realize.
 The last fatal rabies cases in Virginia was in December 1998, when 
 a prisoner died at the Nottoway Correctional Center. That was the 
 first rabies case Virginia had seen since 1953, and was blamed on 
 a bat.

 person. - Mod.JW]
