 New Hampshire: 2nd Case of Human Infection in State
 --------------------------------------------------
 .
 [Now that the 2003 West Nile virus season is in full swing, only 
 extensions of West Nile virus geographic range or host species, and 
 exceptional items, will be posted separately from these weekly 
 updates. - Mod.CP]
 In this update:
 [1] Human, 2nd case (New Hampshire)
 [2] CDC-ArboNET West Nile virus update (Fri 26 Sep 2003)
 The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services' Office of 
 Community and Public Health reports the 2nd positive case of West 
 Nile virus in a New Hampshire resident. The 18-year-old man is from 
 Hillsborough County. He traveled to Florida as well as within the 
 southern part of NH during the period when he would have contracted 
 the disease. He has been released from the hospital after a lengthy 
 stay and is continuing to recover.
 "There is a possibility that this patient acquired West Nile virus in 
 Florida, but we will never know for sure," said Dr. Jose Montero, 
 Chief of the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control. "This case 
 reinforces the need for the public to be vigilant in prevention 
 measures until the end of the season in early November."
 This is the 2nd case of West Nile virus in a New Hampshire resident 
 in 2003 and the 1st year the State has had human cases. A 37-year-old 
 Rockingham County woman also contracted the illness in August after 
 visiting Nebraska. She has since recovered. "Unfortunately, the 
 discovery of human cases in New Hampshire this year is not 
 unexpected," said Dr. Montero. "West Nile is now endemic in the 
 State. The majority of people who become very ill are elderly; the 
 fact that 2 relatively young people have gotten ill is an 
 illustration of the respect we need to show this virus and the 
 measures we must all take to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes."
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta now 
 considers West Nile virus to be a permanent part of the environment 
 in the United States. It first arrived in New York City in 1999 and 
 has steadily spread westward to 44 states and over 4000 human cases 
 nationwide this season. In New Hampshire there have been 209 positive 
 birds and 6 positive mosquito pools this season. The Department of 
 Health and Human Services is no longer collecting birds from 
 Rockingham, Hillsborough, or Strafford counties and the towns of 
 Concord, Keene, and Laconia in 2003, due to the large numbers of 
 positive birds already identified in these communities.
 [This case is not included in the data published in the MMWR weekly 
 update reproduced below. It is not certain, however, that either of 
 the 2 human cases of West Nile virus infection in New Hampshire are 
 indigenous cases; both individuals had travelled beyond New Hampshire 
 and may have contracted infection elsewhere. - Mod.CP]
 This report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data 
 reported to CDC through ArboNET as of 3 a.m., Mountain Daylight Time, 
 Wed 24 Sep 2003.
 During the reporting week of Thu 18 to Wed 24 Sep 2003, a total of 
 690 human cases of WNV infection were reported from 30 states 
 (Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, 
 Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, 
 Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North

 the same period, WNV infections were reported in 1143 dead birds, 231 
 horses, and 529 mosquito pools.
 During 2003, a total of 4827 human cases of WNV infection have been 
 reported from Colorado (n = 1542), Nebraska (n = 788), South Dakota 
 (n = 699), Texas (n = 311), Wyoming (n = 302), Montana (n = 187), New 
 Mexico (n = 153), North Dakota (n = 148), Minnesota (n = 79),

 Of 4770 (99 percent) cases for which demographic data were available, 
 2511 (53 percent) occurred among males; the median age was 47 years 
 (range: 1 month to 99 years), and the dates of illness onset ranged 
 from 28 Mar to 17 Sep 2003. Of the 4770 cases, 93 fatal cases were 
 reported from Colorado (n = 27), Nebraska (n = 13), South Dakota (n = 
 8), Texas (n = 7), Wyoming (n = 7), New York (n = 5), New Mexico (n =

 one), Maryland (n = one), Mississippi (n = one), Montana (n = one), 
 New Jersey (n = one), and North Dakota (n = one).
 A total of 586 presumptive West Nile viremic blood donors have been 
 reported to ArboNET. Of these, 477 (81 percent) were reported from 
 the following 8 western and midwestern states: Colorado, Kansas, 
 Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and 
 Wyoming. Of the 446 donors for whom complete data are reported, 2 
 subsequently developed encephalitis, and 38 subsequently had WNV 
 fever.
 In addition, 8406 dead birds with WNV infection were reported from 42 
 states and New York City; 2143 WNV infections in horses have been 
 reported from 36 states, 12 WNV infections were reported in dogs, 5 
 infections in squirrels, and 17 infections in unidentified animal 
 species.
 During 2003, WNV seroconversions have been reported in 603 sentinel 
 chicken flocks from 13 states. Of the 11 seropositive sentinel horses 
 reported, Minnesota reported 4, Illinois and South Dakota each 
 reported 3, and West Virginia reported one.
 A total of 4941 WNV-positive mosquito pools have been reported from 
 38 states and New York City.
 Additional information about WNV activity is available from CDC at
 <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm> and
 <http://www.westnilemaps.usgs.gov>.
 [In the USA the only states with no confirmed cases of autochthonous 
 West Nile virus infections remain Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada, and Oregon. 
 The epidemic may be beginning to decline. The weekly counts of new 
 human cases during the past 4 weeks have been 414, 1046, 1214, and 
 now 690. So far the 3 western/midwestern states of Colorado, 
 Nebraska, and South Dakota have accounted for 62.8 percent 
 (3029/4827) of the total number of confirmed human cases in 2003. -
