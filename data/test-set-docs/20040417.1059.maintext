 Fox and Cat Join Civet Cat as Confirmed Carriers of the SARS Coronavirus
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 Chinese scientists have found that the coronavirus that causes severe acute 
 respiratory syndrome (SARS) is also carried by foxes and [domestic?] cats, 
 not just civets, according to the Guangzhou Evening Newspaper. Lin Jinyan, 
 the leader of a SARS control and prevention research team in south China's 
 Guangdong Province, reported in a seminar held in Guangzhou that other wild 
 animals were also found to carry the virus.
 The team had tested thousands of people [for] SARS antibodies in 16 cities in 
 Guangdong and found that among 994 people working in animal markets, 10.6 
 percent carried positive antibodies, and among 123 civet cat husbandry staff, 
 only 3.25 percent tested positive.
 Experts have also tested foxes, hedge-shrews and cats collected in the 
 province and discovered that some carried the SARS coronavirus. On 16 Jan 
 2004, World Health Organization experts claimed that the SARS coronavirus 
 or a SARS-like coronavirus was linked to civet cats. WHO epidemiologist 
 Robert Breiman said it's possible that other animals were also involved in 
 the spread of SARS.
 [These observations extend the range of animal species known to harbour the 
 SARS coronavirus (or a closely related coronavirus). The results of the 
 human antibody study suggest that the transmission of SARS coronavirus from 
 civets to humans, if it occurs at all, is less efficient than from some 
 other animals. What is certain is that a very large number of civet cats 
 was destroyed unjustifiably. These data do not establish the direction of 
 transmission of infection -- from animal to man, or the reverse. The origin 
 of the SARS coronavirus remains obscure, and it is possible that the virus 
 has been present in the human population for some time, only developing 
 virulence recently. - Mod.CP]

 This report is also interesting in apparently showing a significant number of 
 SARS survivors in the animal handling population. One might wonder at the 
 specificity of the antibody test used. - Mod.JW]
