 Subject: Emergency Management Warning 73: Exotic Newcastle Disease 
 Confirmed in the United States
 All information in the following Notice marked with an asterisk (*) 
 identifies changes since the last Notice was sent out.
 Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002 in the State of 
 California, and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 22 
 commercial operations in California.  On 16 Jan 2003, END was also 
 confirmed in a backyard flock in the State of Nevada.  A backyard flock was 
 confirmed with END on 4 Feb 2003, in the State of Arizona.  Clinical signs 
 in infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal 
 signs.  Mortality is up to 90 percent of exposed birds.
 Investigations are ongoing and all figures are pending final 
 validation.  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) personnel 
 and other federal government personnel are working with the States to 
 consider additional resources to meet the labor demands at the Task 
 Forces.  APHIS has developed a plan for national END surveillance.  This 
 plan will enhance the already extensive surveillance underway.
