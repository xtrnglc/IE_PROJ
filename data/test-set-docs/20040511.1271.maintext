 Foot and mouth disease in Israel
 -------------------------------------
 .
 Follow-up report No. 2 (final report)
 Information received on 29 Apr 2004 from Dr. Moshe Chaimovitz, Director of 
 Veterinary and Animal Health Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 
 Development, Beit-Dagan:
 End of previous report period: 3 Feb 2004 (see Disease Information, 17 [6], 
 33, dated 6 Feb 2004).
 End of this report period: 29 Apr 2004.
 A total of 8 infected farms in 5 outbreaks were reported during the period 
 from 23 Jan to 17 Mar 2004 (see summary tables below). The only animals 
 infected were young fattening cattle and sheep that had been vaccinated 
 only once against foot and mouth disease (FMD), 6 months before, with a 
 polyvalent vaccine that included FMD virus strain type O.
 In Ein-Hashofet, Yizreel district, wild animals were infected from a 
 neighboring infected farm.
 No new cases of FMD have been reported since 17 Mar 2004. The epizootic is 
 thus seen as closed 30 days after the completion of the favorable evolution 
 of the epidemiological situation and after the results of the 
 epidemiological surveillance activities (screening, inspection, serological 
 testing, and additional studies), which indicated that the infection had 
 not spread.
 Movement restrictions on susceptible animals have been relaxed, but control 
 measures in the outbreak settlements are still in force. Animals in the 
 outbreak settlements are permitted to leave only on the condition that 
 serological surveillance, based on the detection of antibodies to 
 nonstructural proteins of FMD virus, demonstrates the absence of infection.
 Movement restrictions on susceptible animals in outbreak settlements will 
 be lifted, in 6 months time, on the condition that no new clinical signs 
 have been observed.

 to Apr 2004 received from Dr. Moshe Chaimovitz, Director of Veterinary and

 [An overview of the FMD situation in Israel and the Middle East, with some 
 interesting maps, is available at 
 <http://www.israel-embassy.org.uk/agriculture/>.  Another very interesting 
 summary [Foot & mouth disease - Kuwait & Israel19980722.1384] has the 
 comments of our own Mod. AS, submitted before he joined ProMED-mail on a 
 regular basis. I have always contended that ProMED-mail archives, available 
 on the website, are not only a valuable historic record but also 
 interesting reading. You never know whose ideas you might come across. -
