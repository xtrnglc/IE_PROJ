 New Zealand: Further Information Concerning the Suspected Case of Variant CJD
 ------------------------------------------
 .
 A Waikato man is in hospital at Hamilton with an "undiagnosed progressive 
 neurological disease", which neurologists are investigating as [as possibly 
 a case of variant] CJD. [Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is abbreviated 
 in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD]. They have cut out one of his 
 tonsils and sent it to Australia for analysis. New Zealand gets about 3 or 
 4 "normal" CJD cases annually, but has been waiting for the first case to 
 occur among New Zealanders who ate beef products from Britain when infected 
 meat was still being sold and exported from there.
 The Waikato case has roused concerns that it may be linked with mad cow 
 disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), because it has been 
 presenting very unusually, according to one medical expert. A BSE 
 connection would raise considerable worried for New Zealand's beef 
 exporters. The Food Safety Authority's executive director, Dr Andrew 
 McKenzie, said tonight that he was confident New Zealand was BSE-free, and 
 that there was no risk from New Zealand food.
 "Normal" human CJD occurs sporadically, or randomly, in about one in one 
 million people annually. A gene mutation that runs in families causes 5 
 percent to 10 percent of cases of CJD and is regarded as a hereditary form.
 "In contrast to the [sporadic and hereditary] forms of CJD, vCJD has 
 affected younger patients (average age 29 years, as opposed to 65 years for 
 sporadic CJD), has a relatively longer duration of illness (median of 14 
 months as opposed to 4.5 months) and is strongly linked to exposure to 
 BSE," the World Health Organisation said in a recent statement.
 The Waikato patient is 26, and is not known to have travelled overseas, a 
 Ministry of Health spokeswoman said. The director of public health, Dr 
 Colin Tukuitonga, said the man had worked in the agricultural sector for 
 some years.
 New Zealand's agricultural industry was tonight gearing up to fend off any 
 impact the case might have on consumer perceptions of New Zealand meat. A 
 spokeswoman for Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Jim Sutton said that 
 the matter was a human health issue -- there was no mad cow disease, and 
 that there had never been BSE in the national cattle herd, which was 
 closely monitored for neurological illness. The spokeswoman said that a 
 medical expert had reported a serious neurological illness in a New 
 Zealander was "presenting very unusually" and authorities had sent away for 
 tests which would take one or 2 weeks to give a definitive result.
 If the man was confirmed as having variant CJD without having travelled in 
 Europe, epidemiological investigations would be likely to focus on whether 
 he had eaten British meat or foods which might have contained infected 
 nerve tissue from British cattle, or whether he had received blood or 
 tissue transplants which might have been infected. A Health Ministry 
 spokeswoman said tonight she did not know whether the man was a blood donor.
 A senior Federated Farmers official warned 2 years ago that thousands of 
 New Zealanders who travelled to Britain before the dangers of mad cow 
 disease were publicised, or ate infected British meat products in New 
 Zealand, were potentially at risk from the degenerative brain disease, 
 vCJD. New Zealand faced a particular risk because tens of thousands of its 
 young people travelled to Britain before the dangers were recognised. More 
 than 9 percent of New Zealand blood donors have been barred from giving 
 blood because of the risk that they had been infected while overseas, by 
 eating cheap meats, including mince, hamburgers, and sausages. These meats 
 and other products such as stocks and soups, are thought to have been those 
 most likely to contain tissue from the spine and brain of infected cattle, 
 which have been implicated in the rising numbers of vCJD cases in Britain, 
 and some other parts of Europe. Mr Pedersen said overseas customers needed 
 to be given the scientific facts to emphasize that New Zealand livestock 
 had not had BSE.
 "There are a large number of people living in New Zealand now who travelled 
 to and lived in the United Kingdom and ate British beef over the BSE risk 
 period," Mr Pedersen said. "There are also many New Zealanders that have 
 eaten imported products containing British beef marrow and spinal material."
 [The additional information that the patient is 26 years old is compatible 
 with the diagnosis of suspected vCJD, but the absence of a history of 
 travel abroad lessens the suspicion of vCJD. There is no indication that 
 the patient has been the recipient of any form of tissue transplantation or 
 hormone therapy. While transmission via blood donation is a theoretical 
 possibility, there is no evidence of transmission by this route in any 
 other case. Transmission via imported meat products and derivatives from 
 Europe to New Zealand is a possible route, but the risk must be close to 
 negligible in view of the patterns of international trade. - Mods.MPP/CP]
