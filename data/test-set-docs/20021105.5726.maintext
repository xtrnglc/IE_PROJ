 Game Commission Releases Test Results  Proving EHD Caused Deer Deaths in 
 Southwest
 ----------------------------
 Pennsylvania Game Commission Bureau of Wildlife Management Director Calvin 
 DuBrock today announced that test results from one deer found dead in 
 Franklin Township, Greene County, proved that its death was caused by 
 epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD). This marks the first time the disease 
 has been confirmed in Pennsylvania.
 DuBrock noted that the test was conducted by the Southeastern Cooperative 
 Wildlife Disease  Study at the University of Georgia. EHD also was 
 confirmed earlier this year in Maryland, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
 "While we await test results from the other 5 samples sent, we are 
 relatively certain that they also died of EHD, which was recently confirmed 
 across the state border in West Virginia," DuBrock said. "Hunters need to 
 know that, according to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease 
 Study, EHD cannot be contracted by humans."
 DuBrock also advised hunters there is no evidence that humans can acquire 
 the disease by touching or field dressing a deer. However, all hunters are 
 encouraged to wear rubber or latex gloves when handling or field dressing 
 an animal, and wash hands and tools thoroughly after field dressing. In 
 addition, he added there is no evidence the EHD virus is spread through 
 consumption of venison, or that the meat is even affected. As with any wild 
 game, always cook meat thoroughly.
 On 10-11 Oct 2002, Greene County Wildlife Conservation Officers Rod Burns 
 and Randy Crago transported 2 deer carcasses of the 50 dead or sick deer 
 found in Greene County to the state Agriculture Department for testing, but 
 the results were inconclusive. On 19 Oct 2002, Washington County WCO Frank 
 Leichtenberger reported more than 20 dead or sick deer were found in West 
 Finley Township. Since then, additional deer have been found in other parts 
 of Greene and Washington counties.
 EHD is a common disease in white-tailed deer populations of the United 
 States, and is [transmitted through] the bite of insects called "biting 
 midges." In northern states, EHD usually kills the animal within 5 to 10 
 days, but is not spread from deer to deer by contact. While EHD is not 
 infectious to humans, deer displaying severe symptoms of EHD may not be 
 suitable for consumption.
 DuBrock stressed that even though some EHD symptoms are similar to those of 
 chronic wasting disease (CWD) -- such as excessive drooling, 
 unconsciousness and a loss of fear of humans -- there is no relationship 
 between EHD and CWD.
 DuBrock also pointed out that the EHD outbreak should have been squelched 
 by the recent cold weather and icing conditions, which will kill the 
 insects that spread the disease. He noted that EHD, unlike CWD, is a 
 seasonal disease and the affected local deer herd will rebound quickly.
 "The good news from this situation is that the public is reporting these 
 sightings to the Game Commission," DuBrock said. "Should the state's deer 
 herd be infected with more serious diseases, the Game Commission will need 
 to rely on the continued vigilance of the public so that we can respond in 
 a timely manner."
 Matt Hough, Game Commission Southwest Region Law Enforcement Supervisor, 
 urged residents to continue to report unusual sightings by calling the 
 region's toll-free number (1-877-877-7137). The Southwest Region serves 
 Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Cambria, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, 
 Washington and Westmoreland counties.
 Residents in other counties are encouraged to call toll-free numbers in 
 their respective regions.
 In 1996, EHD was suspected to be the cause of death in nearly 25 deer in 
 Adams County. Test results in that case were inconclusive.
