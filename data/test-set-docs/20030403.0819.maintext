 SARS: Detection of a Coronavirus by Virologists at the Institut Pasteur
 -------------------------------------------------
 .
 A coronavirus has been detected in samples obtained from SARS patients in
 Hanoi by Sylvie van der Werf and colleagues in the Molecular Genetics of
 Respiratory Viruses Unit at the Institut Pasteur. Van der Werf's group had
 been invited by the World Health Organisation and the Direction Generale de
 la Sante francaise (DGS) to participate in the international effort to
 investigate the nature of the current SARS outbreak in Asia. One of the
 virologists in her group, Dr Jean-Claude Manuguerra, was a member of the
 team sent to Hanoi by the DGS. The unit is part of the Cellule
 d'intervention biologique d'urgence (CIBU), established in 2002 to provide
 rapid response to disease outbreaks or bioterrorist attacks. The Institut
 Pasteur was assigned the task of investigating the samples from Hanoi, as
 well as suspected cases that might arrive in France from southeast Asia.
 [A report in Europa Press, 31 Mar 2003 <http://www.europapress.es/>
 (submitted by Pablo Nart and translated by Maria Jacobs, ProMED-ESP) stated
 in addition that scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris -- presumably
 those named above -- had identified coronaviruses in samples from 6 patients
 with atypical pneumonia in the Hanoi Hospital in Vietnam, as well as in
 samples obtained from a physician hospitalized in Tourcoing (north of
 France), the first victim of severe acute respiratory syndrome in France.
 Lucien Abenhaim, France's health director-general, stated that the virus has
 an "atypical appearance"
 with features that correspond to the viruses discovered by other
 laboratories around the world, in particular the Centers for Disease Control
 (USA). - Mod.CP]
 Detection of Novel Coronavirus and Human Metapneumovirus Sequences in the
 Same SARS Patients
 ------------------
 [The following description of the virological investigations in Canadian
 SARS patients has been extracted from the paper by Poutanen et al.,
 entitled "Identification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Canada"
 and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. The full paper
 is accessible via the above URL. It confirms previous statements from
 Canadian sources that a human metapneumovirus had been isolated from a SARS
 patient and further appears to indicate the presence of both a novel
 coronavirus and a human metapneumovirus in 4 of 5 virus-positive SARS
 patients. - Mod.CP]
 Viral molecular testing has been completed on all respiratory and blood
 specimens received from 9 of the 10 patients, yielding mostly negative
 results. Specifically, DNA was extracted and PCR was completed for targets
 specific to various DNA viruses, yielding negative results for
 adenoviruses, parvoviruses, circoviruses, herpesviruses, & orthopoxviruses.
 In addition, RNA was extracted and reverse-transcriptase� PCR (RT-PCR) was
 completed for targets specific to various RNA viruses, including influenza
 virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus subtypes 1,
 2, 3, and 4, human metapneumovirus, filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg
 viruses), arenaviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, hantaviruses, and
 Crimean�-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, yielding negative results.
 Further studies were completed on all respiratory specimens received from 9
 of the 10 patients. These included viral cultures (including inoculation
 onto cell culture and into embryonated hen eggs and intracerebral
 inoculation of suckling mice), immune electron microscopy of nasopharyngeal
 swabs and bronchoalveolar fluids with serum obtained during the
 convalescent phase from Patient 10, RT-PCR for conserved portions of the
 polymerase gene of RNA viruses, and genus-specific degenerative primers for
 paramyxoviruses and bunyaviruses with use of nested RT-PCR. Results for all
 of these tests have been negative, with 2 exceptions.
 Human metapneumovirus was amplified by nested PCR from bronchoalveolar
 lavage fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs from 5 of 9 patients with SARS and
 from a nasopharyngeal swab from an asymptomatic contact of one of the
 patients in Toronto (Patient 3) with use of the following primers:
 5'CTTTGGACTTAATGACAGATG3' and 5'GTCTTCCTGTGCTAACTTTG3'.
 For confirmation of these positive findings, the amplicons were sequenced
 and found to be unique, ruling out the possibility of cross-contamination in
 the laboratory.
 In addition, a novel coronavirus was isolated from Vero cell cultures
 inoculated with respiratory specimens from 5 of 9 patients with SARS. 4 of
 these patients had specimens from which metapneumovirus was also
 identified. A cytopathic effect on the Vero cell cultures was noted on day
 6 of incubation. On the basis of collaboration with investigators in Hong
 Kong and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who
 reported isolating a novel coronavirus from patients with SARS in other
 areas of the world, RT-PCR and nested PCR were completed targeting
 conserved regions of the coronavirus polymerase gene using the following
 primer pairs: 5'CAGAGCCATGCCTAACATG3' and 5'AATGTTTACGCAGGTAAGCG3'; and
 5'TGTTAAACCAGGTGGAAC3' and 5'CCTGTGTTGTAGATTGCG3'. A novel coronavirus
 identical to that reported by the CDC was amplified from all 5 cultures.
 At a different laboratory, a coronavirus was also identified independently
 by amplification directly from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid from 2 of 4
 patients tested. Both of these patients had coronavirus isolated from cell
 culture and amplification as described above. Reverse transcription was
 completed using the primer 5'GCATAGGCAGTAGTTGCATC3', followed by PCR
 targeting a highly conserved region of the coronavirus polymerase gene with
 use of the paired primers 5'TGATGGGATGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA3' and
 5'TTGCATCACCACTAGTTGTGCCACCAGGTT3'.
 One of the amplicons was sequenced, and although the nucleotide sequence was
 different from that of any known  coronaviruses, the deduced amino acid
 sequence had a high degree of homology (78 percent) to the polymerase amino
 acid sequence of several coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that
 this is a novel virus that is not closely related to any of the known
 clusters of coronaviruses (groups 1, 2 & 3).
 Further studies are currently being completed to determine whether the human
 metapneumovirus and a novel coronavirus, either alone or in combination, are
 the cause of SARS or whether other thus-far-undetected pathogens are
 possibly responsible. The possibility cannot be excluded that co-infection
 by either virus with another agent may be responsible for SARS.
 [Now that a lab test is widely available for the coronavirus that was
 isolated from 2 SARS patients in Germany, there may be a danger of circular
 reasoning about the etiology.  Any patient who tests positive for the
 coronavirus will be considered confirmation of the etiology, and those that
 test negative (often the majority) will be explained away as due to
 inadequacy of the sample for one reason or another. Nobody may be looking at
 those that test negative to see whether they contain sequences for human
 metapneumovirus, henipaviruses or other paramyxoviruses (the last do not
 appear to have been definitely excluded yet -- remember that 3 independent
 laboratories identified a paramyxovirus from specimens taken from SARS
 patients).  Thus the true etiologic agent may be missed altogether. One has
 to bear in mind -- or explain away -- all the conflicting findings, by
 multiple labs, of viruses from SARS patients that were not coronaviruses.
 The co-infection theory should not cause a distraction from the search for a
 unique etiological agent. - Mod.JW]
