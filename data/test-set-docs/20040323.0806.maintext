 Dolphins Died From Toxin, Tests Show
 -------------------------------------------
 .
 Preliminary test results indicate the deaths of more than 65 dolphins in 
 the Panhandle may have been caused by biotoxin released by naturally 
 occurring algae.
 Jane Whaley, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 
 National Marine Fisheries Service, said domoic acid had been found in water 
 samples.
 Domoic acid has been blamed for several marine mammal deaths on the West 
 Coast, she said.
 [An excellent review of domoic acid in mammals can be found in "Mammal, 
 bird die-off, domoic acid - USA (CA) (02)20020708.4702."
 Domoic acid is a neurotoxic tricarboxylic amino acid structurally related 
 to kainic and glutamic acids. It was chemically identified after its 
 isolation in 1958 from the seaweed _Chondria armata_, found off the coast 
 of Japan. In 1987, more than 100 people became ill and several people died 
 following the consumption of blue mussels caught off Prince Edward Island, 
 Canada. Canadian scientists found that domoic acid had entered the food 
 chain when the mussels fed on a toxic algal bloom of the pennate diatom 
 _Pseudonitzschia pungens_ forma multiseries. - Mod.TG]
