 New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Issues Health Advisory 
 on Food-Borne Illnesses
 ---------------------------
 Earlier this evening, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's syndromic 
 surveillance system detected a higher-than-usual number of visits for 
 diarrheal illnesses at emergency departments in New York City.  The Health 
 Department is continuing to investigate the increase and monitor the trend.
 Health Commissioner Thomas Frieden, MD, MPH, said, "While we do not know 
 the specific cause of this spike in diarrheal illnesses, it is possible 
 that it was caused by spoiled food eaten at home or elsewhere. This 
 underscores the need to make sure that food that spoiled during the power 
 outage is not consumed and is thrown out if there is any doubt as to its 
 safety. It is critical for New Yorkers to avoid getting sick by following 
 food safety guidelines. 
 The 5 key rules are:
 1. Use common sense -- foods, such as dairy products, meat (red meat, 
 chicken, and seafood), and particularly items such as previously cooked rice 
 or potatoes, are not safe to eat after a prolonged period without 
 refrigeration.
 2. Better safe than sorry.
 3. Evaluate each food item separately.
 4. Never taste food to see if it is bad.
 5. "When in doubt, throw it out."
 The Health Department emphasized that testing of the drinking water in New 
 York City by the Department of Environmental Protection continues to confirm 
 that the drinking water is safe.
 Detailed food safety guidelines are given below:
 Perishable, refrigerated foods that have been without refrigeration and at 
 more than 40 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 2 hours should be discarded. 
 Refrigerated foods that should be discarded include meat (red meat, chicken, 
 seafood), hot dogs, bacon, pizza, open canned meats, soft cheeses, milk, 
 yogurt, eggs or egg dishes, fresh cut fruits, opened mayonnaise, 
 Worcestershire sauce, creamy salad dressings, opened tomato sauces, biscuits, 
 rolls, cookie dough, cooked pasta, pasta salads, cheesecake, cream-filled 
 pastries, cooked vegetables, baked potatoes, and potato salad.
 Any perishable food that has thawed for more than 2 hours and is above 40 
 degrees Fahrenheit -- whether from the refrigerator or the freezer -- 
 should be discarded.
 Food items that can be kept for a limited period of time without 
 refrigeration include: Hard, processed cheeses: (e.g., cheddar, swiss, 
 parmesan, provolone, romano); butter, margarine; opened fruit juices, opened 
 canned fruits, peanut butter, jellies and mustards, opened vinegar-based 
 dressings, breads, rolls, cakes, muffins, breads, waffles, pancakes, bagels, 
 pies, fruit, herbs, spices, and raw vegetables.
 Any food items discarded should be disposed of in double-bagged plastic 
 garbage bags and should be well-tied, and/or in sealed plastic containers 
 or sealed (e.g. zipper-locked) plastic bags.
 After the power returned, it was OK to refreeze frozen foods that still 
 contained ice crystals and felt cold. These include beef, veal, poultry and 
 ground meats, fish, shellfish, seafood products, egg products, soft and 
 hard cheese, casseroles, juices, fruits, vegetables, cakes, pies, pastries, 
 flours, cornmeal, and frozen meals.
 As a general rule, a well-functioning freezer that was unopened and at least 
 half full will have kept foods cold for about 24 hours.
 The Health Department has dispatched dozens of inspectors to food 
 establishments citywide to make sure they comply with these guidelines.
 New Yorkers concerned about food poisoning can call the New York City Poison 
 Control Center at (212) POISONS or (212) 764-7667 or 311 and can register 
 complaints though 311 or the DOHMH website at <http://www.nyc.gov/health>. 
 New Yorkers are asked to call 911 only for emergencies. More information on 
 food safety recommendations can also be found at the U.S. Centers for Disease 
 Control and Prevention site at <http://www.cdc.gov>.
 [This outbreak of gastrointestinal illness was picked up by the surveillance 
 system in New York City designed to identify spikes in one of a number of 
 syndromes related to natural or man-made outbreaks. The further evaluation of 
 these illnesses is underway, and the proper triage of food following the 
 power failure is explained above. - Mod.LL]
