 Note on suspicion of a milk replacement as possible source of BSE, Denmark
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 1. Milk replacements:
 The Plant Directorate investigates possible sources of infections from feed 
 in all BSE positive cases in Denmark and has so far finished detailed 
 reports on the first 3 cases out of 7 in total.
 It appears from the report on the 3rd case that the only feed, which has 
 been used in all 3 BSE-positive herds, is the milk replacement "Sundkalv" 
 produced by the firm "Nordmilch EG", Germany, but that contamination with 
 meat and bone meal (MBM) in other feed products used in the herds cannot be 
 ruled out.
 Sundkalv is made in several varieties and is identical with the products 
 'Rod Kalvo' and 'Gron Kalvo' and made up approximately half of the share of 
 the market of milk replacements in Denmark in 1996-1997. The Plant 
 Directorate is investigating how widespread the use of these milk 
 replacements has been in the Danish livestock. According to the producer 
 the products contain fat derived from bones from cattle and swine delivered 
 from slaughterhouses in several European Union (EU) member states. At the 
 time of production of the batches of milk replacements that were used in 
 BSE infected herds, it was not obligatory to remove specified risk material 
 (SRM) in the slaughterhouses in all EU member states. Therefore there is a 
 risk that the product might have been contaminated with fat produced from 
 parts of spinal cord and brain from BSE positive cattle.
 The reports from the Plant Directorate on the last 4 cases are not finished 
 yet, but so far it is evident that the 4th, 5th and 6th case also were fed 
 the same milk replacement. The Plant Directorate is investigating whether 
 this milk replacement was used in the 7th case as well.
 The Plant Directorate has furthermore made investigations regarding animal 
 fat in feed allowing up to 0.15 per cent impurities content and has hereby 
 demonstrated in the fat remnants of protein identical in composition with MBM.
 Denmark's BSE reference laboratory, The Danish Veterinary Laboratory (DVL), 
 is currently conducting a risk evaluation on the use of animal fat as feed 
 for ruminants and the risk entailed using the milk replacements on the 
 market in Denmark. The risk evaluation is made with reference to a possible 
 tightening of the rules concerning production, import, and use of these 
 feedstuffs. The evaluation takes into account international experiences, 
 the available scientific literature on the topic, production procedures for 
 the feedstuff, regulations for removal of SRM, regulations for impurities 
 content in fat etc.
 Furthermore, DVL is working on an epidemiological project regarding the 
 possible causal association of BSE and milk replacements. If the product in 
 question has been used by most of the Danish farmers, there is not 
 necessarily a causal relation between a case of BSE and the use of this 
 milk replacement on the farm. It is expected that the results of the above 
 mentioned investigations might be available in mid 2002.
 Furthermore reference is made to an article in Deutsche Tierarztliche 
 Wochenschrift, no 7 from Jul 2001 on feed ingredients, including fat, and 
 their potential role in the spread of BSE.
 2. Meat and bone meal:
 With a few exceptions there was a ban on import of MBM to Denmark from 1933 
 to 1998. The exceptions allowed import of limited quantities from Norway, 
 Sweden, and Germany.
 In 1990, it was forbidden to use MBM of ruminant origin as feed to 
 ruminants. This feed ban has been tightened several times: on 17 Jan 1997 
 by a ban on the use of MBM of mammalian origin as feed to ruminants, and on 
 01 Jan 2001 by a ban on the use of manufactured animal protein (including 
 MBM) to animals kept, fed, and reared for human consumption.
 In addition to the feed bans there was a tightening, in Jan 1997, of the 
 regulations regarding production of mixed feed to cattle. These were 
 practical measures, which should prevent MBM -- for example, in swine feed 
 -- from contaminating cattle feed. In Apr 1997, with effect from 10 May, a 
 regulation was put into force regarding the rendering of MBM by pressure 
 sterilization (133 degrees C for 20 minutes by 3 Bar pressure).
  From the reports on the first 3 BSE cases made by the Plant Directorate, 
 it appears that cross contamination with MBM cannot be ruled out as a 
 possible source of infection.
 Denmark has so far had 7 cases of BSE in cattle born in Denmark. The 3rd 
 and 7th cases were born on 08 Feb 1997 and 23 May 1998, respectively, after 
 the ban on the use of mammalian MBM to ruminants was put into force.
 3. Conclusions:
 The following possibilities for infection with BSE cannot be ruled out with 
 regard to the first 7 cases of BSE in Denmark:
 1. Contamination with MBM -- for example, by legally used swine -- and 
 poultry feed on the farms or feed mixing systems as well as cross 
 contamination due to the use of feed transport vehicles not properly cleaned.
 2. Animal fat in feed for cattle -- for example, in milk replacements for 
 calves.
 Further conclusions may evolve from the completion of the risk evaluation 
 made by the DVL, the epidemiological survey, and the investigations made by 
 the Plant Directorate.
 [The appearance of BSE in Denmark, a country which officially banned the 
 import of MBMs since 1933, is of particular interest. According to the 
 Danish data <http://www.vfd.dk/java_enab/f_uk.html>, Denmark has carried 
 out 255 951 BSE tests from Jan to Nov 2001, including 17 836 in fallen 
 stock (2 positive); 1682 in emergency slaughtered bovines (all negative); 
 232 167 tests in healthy slaughtered bovines (3 BSE positive); and 12 tests 
 in clinically suspected cases (1 positive).
 The presented Danish notes, kindly forwarded to ProMED by the Danish 
 Veterinary and Food Administration, are valuable also for the assessment of 
 BSE cases in countries which have been regarded, until recently, to have a 
 low risk status and for the evaluation of possible BSE cases appearing in 
 additional countries of the same Geographic BSE Risk (GBR) status. Though 
 not (yet) conclusive, the Danish notes are highlighting again the 
 significant role which cross contamination in EU slaughterhouses has played 
 in the dissemination of BSE by means of infected feed, with special 
 emphasis upon the possible involvement of fat included in milk 
 replacements. The reader may recollect the Japanese publications, 
 circulated by ProMED on 12 Dec 2001, reporting that all 3 Holstein cows, 
 recently found BSE positive there, had consumed a milk replacement (in this 
 case -- according to the media -- the included animal fat was produced in 
 the Netherlands).
 Similar investigations in other countries which have been previously 
 regarded as belonging to GBR of "category II", namely where "BSE is 
 unlikely but it cannot be excluded that cattle is infected (clinical or 
 sub-clinical) with the BSE agent" are highly desirable. Such countries as 
 Finland and Austria might add missing links and enable reaching final 
 conclusions related to the potential role of milk replacements in the 
 recent, current, or potential future spread of BSE. - Mod.AS]
