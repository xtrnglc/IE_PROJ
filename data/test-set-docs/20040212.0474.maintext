 Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection - WHO Update 22
 --------------------------------------------------------
 .
 The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed the country's 6th 
 case of H5N1 infection. The case is a 13 year old boy from Chaiyaphum 
 Province. Preliminary investigation has linked the case to contact with 
 diseased chickens near his home.
 The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today confirmed an additional case 
 of H5N1. The case, which was fatal, was in a 19 year old man who had been 
 hospitalized in Ho Chi Minh City. To date, Viet Nam has reported 19 
 confirmed cases, of which 14 have been fatal.
 WHO is today publishing the 1st clinical and epidemiological data on 10 
 human avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection cases in the Viet Nam 
 outbreak. The data have been compiled by Vietnamese clinicians, 
 epidemiologists, and laboratory scientists involved in the first-hand 
 treatment and investigation of cases. WHO is grateful to these authors for 
 allowing immediate publication of their findings.
 - preliminary clinical and epidemiological description of avian influenza A 
 (H5N1) virus infection in Viet Nam
 A full report on these cases has been accepted for publication in the New 
 England Journal of Medicine. Clinical information on 5 laboratory-confirmed 
 cases in Thailand will be published by WHO tomorrow morning in the Weekly 
 Epidemiological Record.
 Publication of clinical data for 15 cases in the present outbreak sheds 
 important light on distinctive features of illness caused by H5N1 infection 
 that should assist in worldwide surveillance and early detection of cases. 
 A case definition for global reporting, supported by information on 
 appropriate laboratory tests for confirmation of diagnosis, was published 
 by WHO yesterday.
 Up to now, knowledge about H5N1 disease in humans was limited to clinical 
 studies of the 18 cases in Hong Kong in 1997. In that outbreak, patients, 
 who ranged in age from 1 to 60 years, had gastrointestinal symptoms, 
 hepatitis, renal failure, and pancytopenia. These findings indicate that 
 H5N1 infection affects more body organs and systems than normal influenza, 
 in which respiratory symptoms are dominant. Also, unlike normal influenza, 
 death in the 6 fatal cases occurred as a result of the primary viral 
 infection rather than a secondary infection caused by bacteria.
 Laboratory results confirming the first 3 human cases of H5N1 infection 
 were announced on 12 Jan 2004. Today, one month into the outbreak, WHO is 
 issuing a chronology of key events in both the human and poultry outbreaks, 
 which are intricately interrelated.
 WHO is also stressing the need to maintain vigilance for suspected cases 
 and to report suspected disease in humans and animals promptly and 
 transparently. The disease in poultry is still spreading in several areas. 
 In others, progress in controlling the avian outbreak does not mean that 
 the risk to human health has been eliminated.
 Several countries with outbreaks in poultry have weak health 
 infrastructures, with weak capacity for the detection of cases, 
 particularly in rural areas, where the majority of domestic birds are 
 raised. Capacity to diagnose a difficult disease such as H5N1 is also weak. 
 Moreover, as the clinical material published today and tomorrow indicates, 
 the full clinical spectrum of H5N1 illness is unknown. Milder cases of 
 illness could be occurring, yet fail to reach the attention of health care 
 staff.
 As today's report from Viet Nam states, "These (10) cases were identified 
 by alert clinicians in tertiary care hospitals and cannot be taken to be 
 representative of the full range of illness that H5N1 may cause."
 For all these reasons, the current small number of laboratory-confirmed 
 cases cannot be taken as an accurate indication of the magnitude of the 
 present or potential threat to human health.
 Data received from the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network indicate 
 that recent H5N1 viruses are susceptible to oseltamivir, one of the 2 
 licensed neuraminidase inhibitors. All strains tested (4 isolates from 
 humans and 33 isolates from birds) demonstrated in vitro susceptibility to 
 this drug.
 Oseltamivir belongs to one of 2 classes of drugs that can be used to 
 prevent or treat influenza in humans. Studies previously conducted by 
 laboratories in the influenza network have shown that most recent H5N1 
 strains are resistant to the 2nd class of drugs, the M2 protein inhibitors 
 (amantadine and rimantadine).
 [As of Thu 12 Feb 2004, the number of confirmed cases of avian influenza A 
 (H5N1) virus infection in Thailand is now 6, 5 of whom have died, and the 
 number of confirmed cases in Viet Nam is 19, 14 of whom have died. 
 Therefore the total number of confirmed human cases in the region, 
 recognized by WHO, becomes 25, of whom 19 have died. - Mod.CP]
 Since mid-December 2003, 8 Asian countries (Cambodia, China, Indonesia, 
 Japan, Laos, South Korea, Thailand, and Viet Nam) have reported an 
 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry and various other 
 birds caused by influenza A (H5N1) virus. As of 9 Feb 2004, a total of 23 
 [now 25 ; see above] laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A (H5N1) 
 virus infection had been reported in Thailand and Viet Nam. In 18 (78 per 
 cent) of these cases, the patients died. Clinical experience with avian 
 H5N1 disease in humans is limited. The human H5N1 viruses identified in 
 Asia in 2004 are antigenically and genetically distinguishable from the 
 1997 and February 2003 viruses. To aid surveillance and clinical 
 activities, this report provides a preliminary clinical description of the 
 initial 5 confirmed cases in Thailand. Of the 5 laboratory-confirmed cases 
 in Thailand, 4 were in male children aged 6 to 7 years, and one was in a 
 female aged 58 years; all patients were previously healthy. 4 patients 
 reported deaths in poultry owned by the patient's family, and 2 patients 
 reported touching an infected chicken. One patient had infected chickens in 
 his neighborhood and was reported to have played near a chicken cage. None 
 of the confirmed cases occurred among persons involved in the mass culling 
 of chickens.
 Patients reported to hospitals 2-6 days after onset of fever and cough. 
 Other early symptoms included sore throat (4), rhinorrhea (2), and myalgia 
 (2). Shortness of breath was reported in all patients 1-5 days after 
 symptom onset. On admission, clinically apparent pneumonia with chest 
 radiograph changes was observed in all patients, with patchy infiltrates in 
 4 and interstitial infiltrates in one. Diarrhea and vomiting were not 
 reported. Peripheral leukocytes were normal or decreased, and 4 patients 
 had lymphopenia (<1000/microL). Mild-to-moderate elevations in hepatic 
 transaminases were found in 4 patients.
 All patients had respiratory failure and required intubation a median of 7 
 days (range: 4-10 days) after onset of illness. 2 patients had a 
 pneumothorax. 3 patients required inotropic support for decreased cardiac 
 function; 2 patients had renal impairment as a later manifestation. None 
 had documented evidence of secondary bacterial infection.
 Late in the course of illness, 3 patients were treated with oseltamivir for 
 3-5 days. All received empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for 
 community-acquired pneumonia while the cause of illness was under 
 investigation. 4 were treated with systemic steroids for increasing 
 respiratory distress and clinically diagnosed acute respiratory distress 
 syndrome (ARDS) with compatible chest radiograph changes.
 3 children died 2-4 weeks after symptom onset, and one child and the adult 
 died 8 days after symptom onset. All patients had laboratory evidence of 
 influenza A (H5N1) virus infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase 
 chain reaction. In 3 cases, the virus was isolated in tissue culture, and 
 in 3 cases, the viral antigens were identified by immunofluorescent assay.

 The 1997 outbreak of influenza A (H5N1) in Hong Kong established that 
 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses can infect humans directly, with 
 resulting illness that was fatal in 6 (33 per cent) of 18 patients. The 
 viruses were not transmitted efficiently from person to person, and human 
 infections stopped after the culling of poultry. The 2003-2004 avian 
 outbreak is more widespread, with poultry disease reported across much of 
 east and southeast Asia. Direct infection of humans with H5N1 viruses has 
 been confirmed in Thailand and Viet Nam. However, no evidence of sustained 
 person-to-person transmission has been identified.
 Despite the antigenic and genetic differences in the H5N1 viruses causing 
 the current Asian outbreaks, certain clinical features of the 5 human cases 
 described in this report are similar to those of severely affected patients 
 from the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. In all 5 cases, disease was severe, 
 with pneumonia progressing to respiratory failure and death. Early 
 distinguishing features included fever, sore throat, cough, and lymphopenia.
 Other organ involvement included mild-to-moderate hepatitis and later 
 cardiac and renal impairment. In contrast with the cases reported from Hong 
 Kong, gastrointestinal symptoms were not prominent features.
 Because of the severity of disease and the concern for the safety of 
 health-care personnel, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand recommends 
 that hospitalized patients with suspected avian influenza be cared for by 
 using precautions to minimize the risk for airborne transmission. 
 Broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs should be used as empiric treatment for 
 the major causes of pneumonia (e.g., _Streptococcus pneumoniae_), including 
 possible superinfection with _Staphylococcus aureus_. Testing of a limited 
 number of human isolates demonstrates resistance to amantadine and 
 rimantadine. For this reason, treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors 
 should be initiated early. The effectiveness of antiviral drugs against 
 H5N1 infections and the period after which these drugs will provide little 
 or no benefit is not known. A more detailed understanding of the 
 pathogenesis is needed to direct therapeutic approaches such as the use of 
 immunomodulating drugs. Updated recommendations for hospital infection 
 control and treatment are available from WHO at 
 <http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en>.
 The epidemiology of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in Thailand 
 and neighboring countries remains incompletely described, but the confirmed 
 human infections have occurred in geographic areas with recognized avian 
 disease, and 2 patients reported direct physical contact with ill or dead 
 chickens. Of the 5 laboratory-confirmed cases in Thailand, 4 were in boys 
 aged 6 to 7 years, which suggests that boys in this age group might be 
 subject to particular high-risk exposures. Case-control studies in Thailand 
 and Viet Nam should help define specific risk factors for infection and 
 allow for the development of evidence-based public health interventions.
 Control of highly pathogenic avian influenza should include surveillance 
 for affected flocks, aggressive culling on the basis of international 
 guidelines to eradicate foci of infection, careful protection of cullers 
 through the use of personal protective equipment, and use of the currently 
 licensed human trivalent influenza vaccine to reduce the risk for 
 co-infection in poultry workers and cullers, which might lead to genetic 
 reassortment of avian and human influenza viruses . In recent weeks, 
 Thailand has moved aggressively to 1) identify geographic areas with 
 confirmed H5N1 disease in poultry (such as, cull affected flocks and flocks 
 within a 5 km radius), 2) establish controls on the transport of poultry 
 and poultry products out of affected areas, and 3) promote safe 
 food-handling practices.
 Clinicians should be aware of the clinical features of the current human 
 influenza A (H5N1) disease and the potential risk factors for infection so 
 that health-care workers are protected and patients can be identified 
 quickly and managed appropriately. Interim US recommendations for 
 infection-control precautions and the diagnostic evaluation of persons with 
 specific epidemiologic and clinical criteria have been developed.

 Outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) in Asia and interim recommendations 
 for evaluation and reporting of suspected cases: United States, 2004
 --------------------------------------------------
 During the period Dec 2003 to Feb 2004, outbreaks of highly pathogenic 
 avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection among poultry were reported in 
 Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, South Korea, Thailand, and Viet 
 Nam. As of 9 Feb 2004, a total of 23 [now 25; see above] cases of 
 laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H5N1) virus infections in humans, 
 resulting in 18 [now 19; see above] deaths, had been reported in Thailand 
 and Viet Nam. In addition, about 100 suspected cases in humans are under 
 investigation by national health authorities in Thailand and Viet Nam. CDC, 
 WHO, and national health authorities in Asian countries are working to 
 assess and monitor the situation, provide epidemiologic and laboratory 
 support, and assist with control efforts. This report summarizes 
 information about the human infections and avian outbreaks in Asia and 
 provides recommendations to guide influenza A (H5N1) surveillance, 
 diagnosis, and testing in the United States.
 On 12 Dec 2003, an outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection 
 among poultry in South Korea was reported. Subsequent influenza A (H5N1) 
 outbreaks among poultry were confirmed in Viet Nam (8 Jan 2004), on a 
 single farm in Japan (12 Jan 2004), in Thailand (23 Jan 2004), in Cambodia 
 (24 Jan 2004), in China (27 Jan 2004), in Laos (27 Jan 2004), and in 
 Indonesia (2 Feb 2004). On 19 Jan 2004, a single peregrine falcon found 
 dead in Hong Kong also tested positive for influenza A (H5N1) virus, but no 
 poultry outbreak has been identified.
 In Viet Nam, as of 9 Feb 2004, a total of 18 human influenza A (H5N1) virus 
 infections had been reported, resulting in 13 deaths. Patients ranged in 
 age from 4-30 years; 10 patients were aged <18 years. The cases included 
 fatal infections in 2 sisters who were part of a cluster of 4 cases of 
 severe respiratory illness in a single family. In Thailand, influenza A 
 (H5N1) virus infection was confirmed in 4 males, aged 6 to 7 years, and one 
 female, aged 58 years. All 5 patients died. Other cases are under 
 investigation.
 Antigenic analysis and genetic sequencing distinguish between influenza 
 viruses that usually circulate among birds and those that usually circulate 
 among humans. Sequencing of the H5N1 viruses obtained from 5 persons in 
 Viet Nam and Thailand, including one sister from the cluster in Viet Nam, 
 has indicated that all of the genes of these viruses are of avian origin. 
 No evidence of genetic reassortment between avian and human influenza 
 viruses has been identified. If reassortment occurs, the likelihood that 
 the H5N1 virus can be transmitted more readily from person to person will 
 increase. Although all the genes are of avian origin, the current H5N1 
 viruses are antigenically distinguishable from those isolated from humans 
 in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2003.
 Genetic sequencing of the 5 human H5N1 isolates from Thailand and Viet Nam 
 also indicates that the viruses have genetic characteristics associated 
 with resistance to the influenza antiviral drugs amantadine and 
 rimantadine. Antiviral susceptibility testing confirms this finding. 
 Testing for susceptibility of the H5N1 isolates to the neuraminidase 
 inhibitor oseltamivir has demonstrated the sensitivity of these viruses to 
 the drug; testing to determine susceptibility to the neuraminidase 
 inhibitor zanamavir is under way.
 CDC recommends that state and local health departments, hospitals, and 
 clinicians enhance their efforts to identify patients who could be infected 
 by influenza A (H5N1) virus and take infection-control precautions when 
 influenza A (H5N1) is suspected.
 Testing of hospitalized patients for influenza A (H5N1) infection is 
 indicated when both of the following exist: 1) radiographically confirmed 
 pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or other severe 
 respiratory illness for which an alternative diagnosis has not been 
 established and 2) a history of travel within 10 days of symptom onset to a 
 country with documented H5N1 avian influenza infections in poultry or 
 humans. Ongoing listings of countries affected by avian influenza are 
 available from the World Organization for Animal Health.
 Testing for influenza A (H5N1) virus infection also should be considered on 
 a case-by-case basis in consultation with state and local health 
 departments for hospitalized or ambulatory patients with all of the 
 following: 1) documented temperature of >100.4 deg F (>38 deg C); 2) cough, 
 sore throat, or shortness of breath; and 3) history of contact with poultry 
 or domestic birds (for example, visited a poultry farm, a household raising 
 poultry, or a bird market) or a known or suspected patient with influenza A 
 (H5N1) in an H5N1-affected country within 10 days of symptom onset.
 The highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus requires Biosafety 
 Level (BSL)-3+ laboratory conditions for certain procedures. CDC recommends 
 that virus isolation studies on respiratory specimens from patients who 
 meet the testing criteria should not be performed unless all BSL-3+ 
 conditions are met. However, clinical specimens can be tested by polymerase 
 chain reaction (PCR) assays by using standard BSL-2 work practices in a 
 Class II biological safety cabinet. CDC has developed real-time PCR 
 protocols for various respiratory pathogens, including SARS and influenza A 
 and B viruses.
 In addition, commercially available antigen-detection tests can be used 
 under BSL-2 levels to test for influenza. Although these rapid tests for 
 human influenza also can detect avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses, the 
 sensitivity of these tests is substantially lower than that of virus 
 culture or PCR.
 Specimens from persons meeting clinical and epidemiologic indications for 
 testing should be sent to CDC if they test positive for influenza A either 
 by PCR or antigen detection testing, or if PCR assays for influenza are not 
 available locally. CDC also will accept, for follow-up testing, specimens 
 from persons meeting the clinical and epidemiologic indications but testing 
 negative on the rapid tests when PCR assay was not available. Requests for 
 testing by CDC should come through local and state health departments, 
 which should contact CDC's Emergency Operations Center, telephone 770-488-7100.
 (Reported by: CDC/WHO Avian Influenza Response Team.)
 Since 1997, human infection with avian influenza viruses has been confirmed 
 on 5 occasions. The ability of avian viruses to transmit from person to 
 person appears limited. Rare person-to-person infection was noted in the A 
 (H5N1) outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 and in the A (H7N7) outbreak in the 
 Netherlands in 2003, but these secondary cases did not result in sustained 
 chains of transmission or community-wide outbreaks. These previous 
 experiences with avian influenza viruses suggest that limited 
 person-to-person transmission of the current H5N1 viruses could occur.
 The majority of the human H5N1 cases are apparently associated with direct 
 exposure to infected birds or to surfaces contaminated with excretions from 
 infected birds. The family respiratory illness cluster in Viet Nam suggests 
 the possibility of limited person-to-person transmission. However, other 
 possibilities (e.g., transmission through exposure to surfaces contaminated 
 by H5N1-infected poultry feces) cannot be ruled out. Although no evidence 
 for sustained person-to-person transmission of influenza A (H5N1) has been 
 identified, influenza viruses have the capacity to change quickly. 
 Continued monitoring for new transmission patterns is an important aspect 
 of the current investigation.
 In 1997, the influenza A (H5N1) outbreak among persons in Hong Kong ended 
 abruptly after the culling of poultry. However, the current outbreaks 
 present challenges because of the large geographic areas and numbers of 
 affected poultry. Asian poultry populations are maintained both on large 
 commercial farms and in backyard flocks. In addition, infections among wild 
 bird populations might be extensive, and the resources to address this 
 problem are limited in certain affected countries. Because of increasing 
 evidence that avian influenza viruses infect humans, persons involved in 
 the slaughter of poultry potentially infected with avian influenza viruses 
 or their contaminated environments should follow WHO recommendations for 
 worker protection.
 Because the influenza A (H5N1) virus could develop the ability to maintain 
 sustained person-to-person transmission, WHO collaborating centers are 
 working to coordinate vaccine development. Efforts are under way in the 
 United Kingdom and the United States to develop influenza A (H5N1) 
 reference viruses for use in vaccine preparation. The minimum estimated 
 time necessary to complete reference virus development and safety testing 
 is 3 months. Production by vaccine manufacturers of pilot lots of vaccine 
 for clinical testing can begin only after reference virus development and 
 safety testing have been completed. Decisions on whether to proceed with 
 vaccine manufacture will depend, in part, on the evolution of the current 
 outbreaks.
 On 4 Feb 2004, CDC issued an order for an immediate ban on the import of 
 all birds from Cambodia, China (including Hong Kong), Indonesia, Japan, 
 Laos, South Korea, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Birds from these affected 
 countries potentially can infect humans with influenza A (H5N1). This order 
 complements a similar action taken by the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
 (USDA).
 CDC advises that travelers to countries in Asia with documented H5N1 
 outbreaks should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live food 
 markets, and any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from 
 poultry or other animals. More information on travel is available from CDC 
 at <http://www.cdc.gov/travel>. Additional information on influenza viruses 
 and avian influenza is available from CDC at <http://www.cdc.gov/flu>.
