 Serum and spinal fluid samples from a 77 year old Ewing man have tested 
 positive for West Nile virus (WNV) in the Department's Public Health and 
 Environmental Laboratories. Final confirmation of this case will be made 
 through testing by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
 (CDC).
 The Mercer County man was admitted to a Hamilton hospital on 21 Aug 2002 
 with symptoms including fever, stiff neck, and changes in mental state. He 
 remains in hospital, in a serious, but stable, condition.
 Blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 73 individuals are in the process of 
 being tested for the presence of WNV. These individuals had either symptoms 
 or signs that met the established WNV testing criteria, or exhibited most 
 of the symptoms and are from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes 
 with the virus have been discovered. To date, 32 are negative, 1 is 
 positive, and 40 results are awaited.
 Human testing for WNV is being conducted at the New Jersey Department of 
 Health and Senior Services' Public Health and Environmental Laboratory in 
 Trenton and at public health labs in other states. Test results are sent to 
 CDC for confirmation.
