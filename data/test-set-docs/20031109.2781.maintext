 5000 babies to get vitamin B1 injections
 ----------------------------
 .
 Health Ministry officials on Sunday were set to order vitamin B1 injections 
 to some 5000 infants believed to have been fed the soy-based milk 
 substitute "Remedia."
 Vitamin B1 (thiamine), a vital substance, was revealed in tests to be 
 missing from the new formula of the German-made Remedia soya milk product, 
 despite being listed on the packaging as an ingredient.
 Babies that relied exclusively on the milk had no other source of vitamin 
 B1, a Health Ministry official explained. A complete lack of the vitamin 
 leads after a period of time to damage to the central nervous system and 
 the heart.
 3 babies have died and 17 are hospitalized with encephalopathy. The Health 
 Ministry recommends that children who have drunk the milk be given vitamin 
 B1 supplements.
 The ministry claims it was not aware that Remedia had introduced a new 
 formula into the Israeli market.
 The formula is particularly popular among orthodox Jews, who use the 
 non-dairy formula alongside meat meals. Rabbis permitted loudspeakers to be 
 used in their neighborhoods on Shabbat [the Jewish sabbath] to warn parents 
 against using the formula. Announcements about the formula were also made 
 in synagogues. Clalit Health Services reported that over 10 000 calls were 
 received from worried parents whose babies drink the formula, and hundreds 
 of babies who seemed sick were brought to emergency rooms.
 The symptoms of the condition leading to encephalopathy include apathy, 
 nausea, vomiting, and later convulsions and loss of consciousness.
 Schneider pediatricians reported that they were surprised by the 3 cases in 
 one week, as they usually treat one case of encephalopathy -� which can 
 have numerous causes -� in 2 months.  Suspicious, they immediately informed 
 the Health Ministry, which began interviewing the families for in-depth 
 epidemiological investigation. The babies had not been in any contact, but 
 all of them had been fed the non-dairy Remedia formula.  While it has not 
 been proven that the formula had something that caused the illness, the 
 company was informed and told that the product would temporarily be taken 
 off the market.
 Dr. Itamar Shalit, head of the infectious diseases unit at Schneider, said 
 there has so far been no sign so far of any virus, bacteria, or other 
 infectious agent in the babies and that it was not contagious, as no one in 
 the families had been infected. "This is a very rare, enigmatic 
 occurrence," he said. "It is not clear whether the babies have suffered any 
 permanent brain damage, but the brain stem has been affected, according to 
 magnetic resonance instrument scans. Still, it may be reversible. One child 
 who reached Schneider a few months ago suffered brain damage and is still 
 hospitalized, while another recovered completely."
 Shalit said that epidemiological studies and tests would look for some 
 toxic or environmental cause in addition to an infectious agent. The 4 
 babies are attached to a respirator and receiving antibiotics and antiviral 
 drugs at least until a pathogen is ruled out.

 At least 6 babies and infants have been recently hospitalized in Israel in 
 coma with the findings of encephalopathy. 2 of them have died. The cause is 
 unknown as yet. One of the possible culprits is a milk substitute baby 
 formula by the name of Remedia manufactured in Germany. The use of this 
 formula was discontinued by the authorities.
 Thousand of parents are in panic. The product is being analyzed. One 
 possibility is the lack of Vitamin B1 in the actual product though it is 
 supposed to contain it. Other possibilities are an unidentified organism, 
 heavy metals, or an act of terrorism against Israel. It would be of 
 interest to know whether this problem has surfaced in other countries, as 
 this formula is extensively used in Germany and the UK, and maybe in other 
 countries.
 [From the newswire article, it appears as though the encephalopathy is due 
 to a thiamine deficiency resulting from the absence of thiamine from the 
 infant formula.  Dr. Affias raises the question of whether this problem has 
 surfaced in other countries.  More information on the event in Israel -- as 
 well as information on whether this is being observed in other countries -- 
 would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
