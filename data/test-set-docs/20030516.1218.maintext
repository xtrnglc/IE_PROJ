 "No Arkansas residents have been diagnosed with West Nile encephalitis this
 year; however, the identification of West Nile virus in a horse is a
 reminder that the virus is here and we all need to take precautions,"
 Williams said.  "Since the majority of human and veterinary West Nile virus
 cases occurred from June through September [in 2002], a positive horse case
 this early is a little surprising, but some other states have already seen
 positive horses, birds, and even mosquitoes.  It's certainly not too early
 to start protecting yourself and your loved ones from mosquito bites.  We
 especially urge protecting our senior citizens, who are at greater risk of
 the more serious form of the disease."
 West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne infection that can cause encephalitis
 (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (inflammation of the lining of
 the brain and spinal cord). However, less than one percent of persons
 bitten by an infected mosquito experience severe illness.  Most people
 infected with diseases transmitted by mosquitoes -- including West Nile
 virus -- experience no symptoms or have only mild symptoms such as fever
 and headaches. More severe infection can include high fever, severe
 headache, stiff neck, altered mental state, and death. Although those over
 50 years of age are more likely to have severe infections, anyone who
 develops symptoms should consult a physician.
 The Arkansas Department of Health will begin surveillance for West Nile
 virus in dead blue jays and crows on Mon 19 May 2003.  Citizens may bring
 birds of these species to their county health unit.  Testing will end in a
 county once a positive bird is confirmed, and we know virus is present in
 the county.
