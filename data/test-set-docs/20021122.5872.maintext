 Possible Rabies-like Infection in Scotland
 -------------------------------------------
 .
 A man has been admitted to hospital in Scotland with an acute neurological 
 illness that is being investigated as a suspected case of rabies (1,2). The 
 possible diagnosis of a rabies-like illness is being considered because of 
 some aspects of the clinical presentation and because the man is a bat 
 handler who has been bitten by a bat in Scotland on at least one occasion 
 within the possible incubation period for rabies. There is no documented 
 evidence that the patient has ever received rabies immunisation or has 
 travelled abroad since 1996. Although the clinical features of the man's 
 illness are compatible with some aspects of rabies, none of the laboratory 
 investigations yet indicates that a rabies-like virus is responsible. 
 Testing for rabies and rabies-like virus is not, however, straightforward 
 and more tests are being undertaken. The case has raised awareness of the 
 possibility of rabies-like virus infection of bats in the United Kingdom 
 (UK) (3). European bat lyssavirus:
 The rabies-like viruses carried by insectivorous bats in Europe are 
 referred to as European bat lyssaviruses (EBLs). These are from the same 
 family of viruses that cause rabies in terrestrial mammals and in bats in 
 the Americas, but differ in genotype and serotype. They are EBL 1 and 2, 
 and are of rabies virus genotype 5 and 6, respectively. Classical rabies is 
 due to rabies virus genotype 1. Between 1977 and 2000, 630 cases of EBL 
 infection in bats were reported in Europe, mostly in Denmark, the 
 Netherlands, and Germany (4). Only 2 EBL infections have been confirmed in 
 UK bats: one on the south coast of England in 1996 (5) and another in 
 northwest England in 2002 (6,7). Both of these bat rabies infections were 
 in the same species -- the Daubenton's bat. In the case in 1996 it was 
 thought that the bat might have migrated from continental Europe. The 
 location of the 2002 Lancashire case is, however, more consistent with EBLs 
 being present in a bat species in the UK. The Veterinary Laboratories 
 Agency in the UK tests about 200 bats every year for EBL, but has not so 
 far detected the virus other than the 2 cases in 1996 and 2002 (8).
 EBLs do not readily cross the species barrier, and even in parts of Europe 
 where bats are known to carry EBLs, it is very rare for other animals to be 
 infected (9). The risk of EBL infection being passed to domestic pets such 
 as dogs and cats, and to wild terrestrial mammals, is very low, and the 
 rabies-free status of the UK has been unaffected by the previous isolation 
 of EBL in 2 bats in the UK.
 As EBL does not transmit readily to other species, infection in humans is 
 extremely rare. Only 3 human cases have been reported in Europe since 1977, 
 one in Finland and 2 in the former Soviet Union. All 3 have been in people 
 who had been in close contact with bats. One was a bat handler and the 
 other 2 had been bitten (10-13). A 15-year-old girl died about 5 weeks 
 after being bitten by a bat on the finger in the Ukraine in 1977 (13). In 
 Russia in 1985 an 11-year-old girl died 4 weeks after being bitten on the 
 lower lip by a bat (13). Also in 1985, a 30-year-old Finnish man presented 
 with ascending paralysis and pain in the arm and neck 51 days following a 
 bat bite in Finland (11). He progressed to becoming agitated, with 
 hyperventilation and spasms, and died 20 days following admission. None of 
 these patients had received specific treatment after their exposure. The 
 different rabies-like viruses and bat species found in Europe distinguish 
 this region from the Americas, where the risk of rabies following human 
 contact with bats is higher (14).
 Prevention of European bat lyssavirus infection in humans:
 Bats present virtually no risk to the general public and are protected by 
 law in the UK. If a member of the public comes across a bat, for example 
 because it is injured, they should not touch the bat but seek help. Only 
 licensed or volunteer bat handlers should routinely come into contact with 
 bats, and they should take suitable precautions, including wearing 
 bite-proof gloves. The Department of Health for England has advised that 
 all bat handlers, whether licensed or not, should have pre-exposure 
 immunization against rabies (15). Bat handlers should have booster rabies 
 vaccination every 3 to 5 years.
 Post-exposure prophylaxis:
 The change in policy also affects management of close exposures to bats in 
 the UK. Prophylaxis for exposure to EBL is the same as that recommended for 
 other potential rabies virus exposures and appears to be highly effective 
 (16). Vaccine failures are very rare if an appropriate post-exposure 
 regimen is followed (17). Experience has been gained in The Netherlands, 
 where EBLs are prevalent. There, as in the UK, people who have been bitten 
 by an EBL virus-positive bat are advised to be vaccinated with rabies 
 vaccine as for classical (genotype 1) strains. It has been shown that there 
 is cross-immunity between genotype 1 and genotype 5 (EBL 1) and genotype 6 
 (EBL 2) strains (18), but it is not known whether rabies vaccines are 
 completely protective against EBLs. Over the last 2 decades several hundred 
 people in the Netherlands have been vaccinated with genotype 1 rabies virus 
 vaccines after being bitten by an EBL-positive bat, and no EBL infection 
 has ever been confirmed in a human being in the Netherlands (WHM van der 
 Poel, personal communication, 20 Nov 2002).
 Anyone who has been scratched or bitten by a bat, or who has experienced 
 contact between bat saliva or neural tissue and their eyes, broken skin, or 
 mucous membrane should, after assessment, be offered post-exposure 
 vaccination as soon as possible after the incident. If the person is 
 already fully immunised against rabies, they should be offered 2 doses of 
 vaccine. If they were previously unimmunised or incompletely immunised, 
 they should be offered 5 doses of vaccine. For those who were previously 
 unimmunised, and who have been bitten by a bat that is known, or strongly 
 suspected, to be rabid, rabies immunoglobulin may be offered in addition to 
 a full course of vaccine. In view of the occasionally prolonged incubation 
 period of rabies, post-exposure vaccination should also be offered to any 
 individuals who have been exposed to bats as described above at any point 
 in the last year if they did not receive post-exposure vaccination at the 
 time of the incident.
 General background information about bats in the UK can be obtained from 
 The Bat Conservation Trust website at 
 <http://www.bats.org.uk/bat_info.htm>. Public health authorities in other 
 countries should note the change of policy so that returning travellers who 
 report exposure to bats in the UK are offered prophylaxis if appropriate.
