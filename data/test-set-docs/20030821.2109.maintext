 USA (Alaska): More Cruise Ship Passengers Succumb to Viral Gastroenteritis
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 A gastrointestinal virus has infected about 24 passengers on a Holland 
 America Cruise Lines ship from Seattle. Cruise line officials wouldn't say 
 how many passengers on the liner "Amsterdam" fell ill, but SuAnn Jenkinson of 
 the state epidemiology lab in Anchorage estimated the number at 25, including 
 a crew member.
 Jenkinson had been in contact with the cruise line's chief medical officer. 
 She said the number of cases didn't reach the 3 percent threshold that 
 triggers a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] response. 
 Rose Abello, vice president of public relations for Seattle-based Holland 
 America Cruise Lines, said on Thursday that an undisclosed number of ill 
 passengers were removed from the ship at stops in Sitka and Juneau and 
 flown home at the cruise line's expense.
 In addition to removing infected passengers, Abello said, crew members have 
 been cleaning the ship regularly and asking passengers to wash their hands 
 often. The cruise line established a procedure for reacting to viral 
 infections after a series of Norwalk-like virus outbreaks in 2002 on board 
 Holland America ships in the Caribbean, Abello said. Abello said the virus 
 has not been identified, so she could not say whether the outbreak was due 
 to norovirus infection.
 Just last week, the Star Princess, a Princess Cruises ship sailing between 
 Seattle and Alaska, had an outbreak of stomach illness among its passengers 
 and crew. A total of 112 passengers and 14 crew members vomited and had 
 diarrhea [resulting from norovirus infection] during the ship's 7-day 
 cruise, Princess Cruises spokesman Tom Dow said. No one was hospitalized.
 The first report of the recent illness came within 24 hours after the ship 
 left the Seattle port, Abello said. It usually takes 48 to 72 hours after 
 infection for symptoms to appear, so it is likely the virus was carried on 
 board by an infected passenger, she said.
 Holland America's "Amsterdam" was one of several ships that experienced 
 infections in 2002 during Caribbean cruises. Outbreaks also occurred on the 
 Holland America ship Statendam and the Disney cruise ship Magic. 
 [The outbreaks of sudden-onset gastroenteritis observed on cruise ships have 
 usually been shown to be a consequence of norovirus infection, frequently 
 introduced by an infected passenger or crew member. Norovirus infection is a 
 disconcerting illness which rapidly runs its course without serious outcome. 
 In general, the problem is now well-recognized and the cruise line 
 managements have procedures in place to contain the spread of infection. -
