 The Brucellosis Survey is being carried out by FAO (Food and Agriculture 
 Organization in U.N.)-Tajikistan for 2 months, Apr-May 2003, with funding 
 from Sweden and Norway is a follow-up action of the recent workshop jointly 
 organized by FAO and MoA on brucellosis in Dushanbe, where the Public Health 
 Department of the MoH reported a sharp increase in the annual number of human 
 brucellosis cases. 
 Confirmed human brucellosis has been reported in some districts as high as 
 371 new cases per 100 000 persons (Tavildara in RRS). Pending confirmation of 
 funding, a brucellosis control programme in high risk districts will be 
 initiated in 2003 by FAO in Tajikistan and monitored by the Government 
 veterinary and public health units in order to reduce the disease incidence 
 in animals and humans.  
 An epidemiologically sound and agreed control programme is needed if the 
 incidence of brucellosis in animals and humans is to be effectively reduced. 
 Not all districts can be covered; therefore the number of districts addressed 
 in such a programme must be determined by known brucellosis prevalence. 
 Determining which districts are at highest risk is therefore the objective of 
 the current Brucellosis Survey. The programme will be implemented at low cost 
 utilising government veterinarians who are supported under contract by FAO, 
 and by fostering collaboration between the human and animal health units of 
 Government and the international organizations.

 this survey may now be available.  Any information would be gratefully 
 received. - Mod.JW]
