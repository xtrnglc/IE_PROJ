 2003/137 Present situation of Coconut cadang-cadang cocadviroid in the 
 Philippines
 -----------
 Coconut cadang-cadang cocadviroid [CCCVd] (EPPO A1 list) causes serious 
 economic losses to the coconut industry in the Philippines. Losses of 1.1 
 million EUR are expected in coconut farms located in the regions of Bicol, 
 Aurora, and Quezon (regions and provinces of Luzon island) and Eastern Samar 
 (province of Samar island). Coconut cadang-cadang disease occurs in the 
 central-eastern part of the Archipelago and affects approximately 500 000 ha 
 of coconut trees. CCCVd occurs in: Polillo island, Luzon island (parts of the 
 provinces of Aurora, Camarines Sur (area of Bicol), Quezon), Samar island 
 (province of Eastern Samar), Masbate, and Homohonhon islands.

 [Coconut cadang-cadang, a lethal disease restricted to the Philippines, was 
 first reported in 1937. CCCVd is the most serious of all known viroids 
 because of its lethality. It has killed over 40 million coconut palms and 
 still kills between 200 000 - 400 000 palms annually. It is spread by unknown 
 means, is seed-transmitted (1/320 seedlings), and also transmitted by pollen. 
 CCCVd contains 246 or 247 nucleotides and is the smallest known nucleic acid-
 containing pathogen. Coconut palms less than 10 years old are rarely 
 affected, but disease incidence increases rapidly to about 40 years, 
 remaining constant thereafter. Disease management basically involves 
 eradication of infected palms when they become symptomatic. No resistance to 
 CCCVd has been identified. The related Coconut tinangaja disease, reported in 
 1917, is confined to Guam, where it affected 30 percent of coconut plants and 
 led to the end of commercial production on the island.
 CTiVd and CCCVd are the only viroids that infect monocotyledons. Inasmuch as 
 CCCVd and CTiVd occur separately in the Philippines and Guam, respectively, 
 it would be interesting to monitor differences in genomic sequences between 
 the 2 viroids over time.
