 ALBANY, N.Y. -  New York will no longer import deer and elk as a 
 precautionary step to prevent the introduction of chronic wasting 
 disease (CWD) in animals, state environmental and agricultural 
 regulators said Friday. The new regulations take effect immediately.
 "By banning the import of deer and elk into the state, we can reduce 
 the risk of the chronic wasting disease entering New York and help to 
 prevent our abundant wild deer herds from being exposed to this 
 deadly disease," said Erin Crotty, commissioner of the state 
 Department of Environmental Conservation.
 More than 400 entities in the state raise nearly 10 000 deer and elk 
 in captivity and routinely import captive-bred deer and elk from 
 other states.
 Chronic wasting disease is characterized by weight loss in animals 
 and is always fatal. The disease has been diagnosed in captive 
 members of the deer family in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana, 
 Oklahoma and South Dakota.
 There are no known cases of the disease in New York.
 [This is juxtaposed with the re-population of the Tennessee and 
 possibly the North Carolina Appalachians with imported elk. However, 
 if there are no cases of the disease in New York, then why have we 
 heard nothing about surveillance? Is New York even looking for the 
 disease? - Mods.MPP/TG]
