 [In response to a German subscriber's request for official information 
 on a measles epidemic in Italy, Dr. Stefania Salmaso was contacted and 
 her reply is below. - Mod.MPP]
 Regarding the measles outbreak in Campania, in the period January-
 April 2002 data from the sentinel pediatric surveillance show an 
 incidence of approximately 1600 cases per 100 000 population, which 
 corresponds to more than 15 000 cases in children less than 15 years of 
 age. The highest incidence is in the age group 5-9 years, followed by 
 10-14 years. These data refer only to Campania and are based on the 
 observation of 41 000 children less than 15 years of age (that is 4 
 percent of the regional total of the same age group).
 In the period January-May 2002 there were 368 hospitalizations in 
 Campania due to measles, 83 percent of which were in children less 
 than 14 years of age.  There were 13 cases of encephalitis (all in 
 individuals less than 20 years of age) and 3 deaths (in children aged 6 
 months, 4 and 10 years).
 The epidemic is attributable to a poor vaccination coverage (the most 
 recent estimate refers to the 1998 birth cohort, and is of 53 percent by 
 24 months of age). In May 2002, the Campania Regional Health 
 Authority recommended vaccinating all the susceptible children and 
 adolescents. Since there were cases in children less than 1 year of age, 
 vaccination was recommended also in infants aged 6-11 months, who 
 must receive a 2nd dose after 12 months of age.
 Measles cases were also observed in the 20 other regions in Italy, but 
 the incidence is much lower (a mean of 33 per 100 000 cases). Data on 
 the monthly incidence of measles cases by region are available on the 
 web in Italian:The first international announcement of this outbreak appeared in the 4 
 Apr 2002 Eurosurveillance Weekly.  There will be an update provided 
 to Eurosurveillance Weekly for this week.
 [Many thanks to Dr. Salmaso for this report. For readers who are 
 interested in seeing the monthly incidence data with an excellent 
 mapping by region, go to <http://www.spes.iss.it/Report.htm> and 
 select the month of interest: for disease (mallatia) put in "morbillo" for 
 measles.  The data on the website are very well presented and readable 
 even for those of us who do not read Italian.  As clearly stated in the 
 above summary, the ongoing outbreak is related to low vaccination 
 coverages with a resultant large cohort of susceptibles, a situation in 
 which a resultant outbreak is not unexpected.  The measures taken to 
 start immunization at 6 months of age with a follow-up dose after 12 
 months of age are prudent. - Mod.MPP]
