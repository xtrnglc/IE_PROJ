 North Carolina: Hepatitis Scare May Be Part of Multistate Outbreak
 --------------------------------------------------
 .
 State and federal health officials are concerned the cases of hepatitis A 
 virus infection in Buncombe County could be part of a multistate outbreak. 
 Dr. Jeff Ingle, head of the Communicable Disease Control Program for the 
 North Carolina Division of Public Health, said hepatitis outbreaks also 
 have occurred in Tennessee (see [2] below) and Georgia (see [3] below), and 
 officials are investigating whether affected restaurants had common food 
 suppliers.
 "The other connection could be with these multi-day camp-out rock 
 festivals," Ingle said. "Food preparation is largely unregulated and the 
 sanitation can be less than ideal." The Centers for Disease Control and 
 Prevention have issued a warning about the outdoor festivals featuring 
 various "jam bands." Information on the CDC Web site says 26 cases of 
 hepatitis A virus infection have been reported among residents of 10 states.
 Officials also are concerned about diners who don't live in the area and 
 may not know they've been exposed. Alerts have gone out to every state 
 department of health, Ingle said, but it's impossible to reach everyone. 
 Dwight Butner, owner of Vincenzo's in downtown Asheville, and President of 
 the Asheville Independent Restaurant Association, hopes the outbreak won't 
 affect tourism as foliage season approaches. "But the main concern here is 
 the health of our workers and patrons," he said. "Whether people stay away 
 is certainly a concern for business, but that will pass as soon as the 
 outbreak is over. All we can do is make sure we're all extremely vigilant 
 about hygiene and food handling issues and hope this is the end of it."
 Dr. Susan Mims, medical director of the Buncombe County Health Center, is 
 concerned with containing the outbreak here. So far, 10 cases have been 
 recorded in Buncombe County, all related to food handlers at Doc Chey's 
 Noodle House and Laughing Seed Cafe. People who ate at either of those 
 restaurants between 16 and 21 Sep 2003 are urged to go to the health center 
 for free immune globulin shots. So far, the health center has administered 
 more than 3000 shots.
 Immune globulin only works to prevent hepatitis A virus infection for 2 
 weeks after exposure, so anyone exposed before 16 Sep 2003 who has not had 
 a shot should watch for symptoms - fever and chills, fatigue, nausea, 
 vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Symptoms 
 can appear any time between 15 and 50 days after exposure. "The best 
 prevention is hand-washing," Mims said. "Frequent and thorough 
 hand-washing. I can't emphasize that enough."
 However, once the virus is in food, hand-washing won't help, Ingle said. 
 Cooking will deactivate the virus, but there's still danger in salads, and 
 raw shellfish can carry the virus no matter how clean the food handler is. 
 The only way to get permanent protection is with the hepatitis A vaccine, 
 which is administered in 2 doses 6 months apart. Ingle said inoculating 
 everyone who works in a restaurant isn't feasible because the rate of 
 employee turnover is so high. "It's a fairly transient population," he 
 said. "There's been talk of requiring all food handlers to be inoculated 
 for a long time, and we asked Duke University to do a feasibility study in 
 the mid-1990s. That study found it just wasn't economically sound." 
 However, some restaurants and catering businesses do offer to pay for 
 hepatitis A vaccine shots for their workers. Eventually, Ingle said he 
 expects the hepatitis A vaccine to become a common childhood inoculation.

 A cluster of hepatitis A cases has been confirmed among workers at 
 O'Charley's Restaurant, located in the Turkey Creek retail development in 
 West Knoxville. People who ate uncooked foods at this restaurant may be at 
 risk for developing hepatitis A. Specifically, persons who ate salads and 
 other uncooked food items, or who drank iced drinks may have been exposed 
 to the virus.
 Medication called immune globulin may prevent infection or diminish the 
 severity of the illness, but only if it is given within 2 weeks of 
 exposure. Persons who ate high-risk food items should receive an injection 
 of immune serum globulin if their exposure occurred between 5 Sep and 14 
 Sep 2003. Investigators have determined that there was no exposure in the 
 restaurant after 14 Sep 2003.
 Because there was a University of Tennessee football game in Knoxville on 6 
 Sep 2003, a large number of people from outside the Knoxville area may have 
 eaten at the restaurant and will need to be treated. Individuals 
 potentially exposed on 5 Sep 2003 must receive immune globulin by Fri 19 
 Sep 2003 in order for the medication to be potentially effective; those 
 exposed on 6 Sep 2003 must receive immune globulin by Sat 20 Sep 2003.
 The Knox County Health Department is offering free shots of immune globulin 
 for people who live in the Knoxville/East Tennessee area, and the Tennessee 
 Department of Health will offer shots for individuals who ate at the 
 restaurant but who live in other areas of the state. The medication is free 
 of charge.
 Health officials are investigating a hepatitis A outbreak in Georgia, to 
 see whether the cases have a common link. At least 116 cases of the liver 
 disease have been reported since 1 Aug 2003, more than double the number in 
 August and September of 2002.
 In an average year, Georgia records about 400 cases of the disease, usually 
 spread by eating food contaminated with infected stool. Restaurants and 
 food distributors are potential sources. An outbreak in Knoxville this 
 month was traced to a restaurant. A food handler at a restaurant in 
 Asheville, North Carolina (see [1] above), recently acquired hepatitis A, 
 prompting hundreds of patrons to get shots to prevent the disease. 
 Georgia's cases could be connected to those outbreaks, officials say.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is looking into the cases in 
 Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, spokesman Dave Daigle said. The CDC 
 did not provide further details. One possibility is a phenomenon the CDC 
 reported in other states this summer: clusters of young attendees of 
 outdoor "jam band" concerts contracting the disease, possibly from poor 
 sanitary conditions.
 No cause has been identified for the Georgia outbreak, and the cases appear 
 to be spread around the state, Richard Quartarone, spokesman for the 
 Georgia Division of Public Health, said on Fri 26 Sep 2003. "We're starting 
 to do some very aggressive investigating to see what in the world may be 
 going on. We're trying to focus on combinations of geography and behavior." 
 Georgia health officials are asking patients where and what they have eaten 
 and whether they have been to any large events. Since people don't become 
 ill until about a month after they are infected, investigations are difficult.
 Health officials also are working with organizers of this weekend's Blue 
 Ridge HarvestFest in LaFayette, a jam and folk music gathering just south 
 of Chattanooga, to encourage frequent hand washing, Quartarone said. No 
 specific problem has been identified with the festival or the music groups 
 involved.
