 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 The NPPO of Finland has informed the EPPO Secretariat that Pepino mosaic
 potexvirus (PepMV, EPPO Alert List) was identified for the first time in
 Finland in March 2001. So far, the virus has been found at 6 tomato fruit
 production sites (glasshouses). ... All infected tomato plants were
 eradicated. The origin of the introduction ... is unknown. The situation of
 Pepino mosaic potexvirus in Finland can be described as follows.

 [Pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) is a small, shrubby plant which produces large
 (up to 15 cm diameter) fruit with a sweet smell, subtle flavor, and
 attractive yellow/golden skin color often with purple stripes. It is grown
 widely in the north of South America and cultivated extensively in Chile.
 PepMV, a member of the genus Potexvirus, was first reported in pepino in
 Peru in 1980, and has subsequently spread to Europe. The virus is highly
 contagious and has a significant potential to cause damage in protected
 tomato production. It often occurs in mixed infection with Potato virus S.
 PepMV is serologically related to Narcissus mosaic virus and Cactus virus X.
