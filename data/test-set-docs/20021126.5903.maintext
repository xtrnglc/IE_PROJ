 Emergency Dept. Closed by Suspected Outbreak of Winter Vomiting Disease
 --------------------------------------------------
 .
 An outbreak of what is suspected to be winter vomiting disease forced the
 closure of Sunnybrook Hospital's emergency department on Monday morning.
 Over the weekend, a number of patients and staff were stricken by bouts of
 vomiting and diarrhea. By Monday afternoon 25 Nov 2002, 28 staff members and
 13 patients showed symptoms of the virus infection, which is highly
 contagious and spread through person-to-person contact.
 "We haven't determined what the infection is yet. We suspect it to be a case
 of something called winter vomiting disease," hospital spokesman Craig
 DuHamel said. "Obviously we have to be very vigilant to ensure this is
 contained in our emergency department." The emergency department was
 expected to be closed until the afternoon of Wed 27 Nov 2002 at least,
 DuHamel said, adding that cleaning crews were on the scene with anti-viral
 agents [disinfectants?].
 Patients walking into emergency were told about the situation upon arrival
 and, if their condition was stable, asked to go to another hospital. Those
 who were unable to go to another facility would be treated, the hospital
 said in a news release. Winter vomiting disease is an infection caused by a
 virus commonly transmitted from person to person in cold weather, when
 people are indoors more often and in closer contact. Symptoms include severe
 nausea and vomiting that can last between 24 and 48 hours. DuHamel said the
 virus is not life-threatening and is similar to the Norwalk virus, which has
 made headlines recently for sickening hundreds of passengers on the
 Florida-based cruise ship
 Amsterdam.
 [As has been repeatedly stated in ProMED-mail, "winter vomiting disease" is
 a misnomer. Outbreaks in the UK and Ireland have occurred throughout the
 year in hospitals, health care facilities, and schools. In North America
 outbreaks on cruise ships have occurred during voyages to Alaska in the
 summer and to Caribbean destinations in the winter. Density and hygiene
 considerations are probably the relevant determining factors. Winter
 vomiting disease is caused by infection with a Norwalk-like virus, although
 this is seldom confirmed microbiologically. Norwalk-like viruses are a
 heterogenous group of caliciviruses that is now designated as the genus
 _Norovirus_. - Mod.CP]
