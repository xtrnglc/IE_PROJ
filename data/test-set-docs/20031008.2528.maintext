 Mexico: West Nile Virus Infection Surveillance Data as of Mon 6 Oct 2003
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 The following figures are reproduced from the Resumen Epidemiologica 
 accompanying the Maps of West Nile Virus Activity in Mexico
 As of Mon 6 Oct 2003, a total of 481 individuals resident in 20 of the 32 
 states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection: 477 were 
 seronegative and asymptomatic and 4 were classified as West Nile 
 virus-positive: 3 in the state of Chihuahua and one (confirmed by RT-PCR) 
 in the state of Sonora. [West Nile virus-positive cases were not reported 
 among the 452 individuals tested in the data reproduced in the previous 
 ProMED-mail update dated 24 Sep 2003. - Mod.CP]
 As of Mon 6 Oct 2003, a total of 4472 horses from 20 of the 32 states have 
 been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these animals 
 1453 were seropositive and 3018 seronegative. All these animals were 
 asymptomatic. In addition one animal in the state of Nuevo Leon, which had 
 the 2nd highest incidence of seropositive animals, was symptomatic and 
 died. [The number of fatal cases is unchanged since 24 Sep 2003. - Mod.CP]
 As of Mon 6 Oct 2003, a total of 17 168 birds from 8 of the 32 states have 
 been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds 63 
 were seropositive (and considered to be asymptomatic) and 17 103 were 
 seronegative. In addition 2 dead birds were seropositive. [The number of 
 West Nile virus-positive birds is unchanged since 24 Sep 2003. N.B. The 
 total for seronegative birds given in the original table is incorrect in 
 that it omits data for the state of Chihuahua. - Mod.CP]
 [These new data report the 1st West Nile virus-positive human cases in 
 Mexico. Overall the data are strikingly different from those recorded in 
 North America with regard to the lower incidence of disease and mortality 
 in Mexico in the case of animals that have tested seropositive for West 
 Nile virus infection. As commented previously, this situation raises 
 questions about the possible existence of cross-reactivity as a consequence 
 of infection with other related flaviviruses, both in terms of conferring 
 protection and generating false positivity. Further information is awaited 
 with interest. - Mod.CP]
