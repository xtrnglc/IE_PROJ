 Human anthrax cases in Murshidabad, West Bengal
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 In the last 3 months more than 30 anthrax cases have been reported from 
 Murshidabad District of West Bengal in India. The cases were found mainly 
 in the Hariharpara and Domkal areas. In all cases there was a history of 
 eating meat from a sick cow. In West Bengal this a common practice in all 
 tribal areas as well as in poor communities -- at least we are getting this 
 constant history for a pretty long time.
 Interestingly, we are not getting cases of intestinal anthrax; as also in 
 this situation, the main manifestations are blisters and ulcers. As pointed 
 out by Dr. Hugh-Jones, preventive aspects should be thoroughly explored -- 
 instead of the public awareness programs which are currently practiced in 
 the affected areas.
 [It has been found that populations who regularly eat anthrax-infected 
 carcasses have a moderate prevalence of antibodies, which, unfortunately or 
 fortunately -- depending on how one interprets the data -- is believed to 
 suppress the incidence of clinical disease and thereby provides an excuse 
 to those communities to continue to eat this high-risk meat. Our thanks to 
 Dr Das for his informed comments. - Mod.MHJ]
