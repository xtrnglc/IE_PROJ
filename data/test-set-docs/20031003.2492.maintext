 Japan: Progress in Investigation of Blood Donation Screening
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 The virus probably slipped through a new blood screening test started in 
 1999, officials say. A highly sensitive screening test likely failed to 
 detect tainted blood used in transfusions to a man who has since tested 
 positive for HIV, the Health Ministry said. If officials confirm the man 
 contracted HIV from tainted blood, it will be the first such case since the 
 introduction in 1999 of the nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) to screen 
 donated blood.
 The man, whose name and age were withheld, underwent the transfusions as an 
 inpatient at a hospital in the Kanto region between March and July [2003] 
 to treat anemia caused by kidney trouble, Ministry officials said. Blood 
 donated by 8 people was used in the transfusions. He received red blood 
 cells under the treatment. The man was found to be HIV-positive in 
 September, after transferring to another hospital, the officials said. The 
 man's doctors said the possibility he caught HIV, the virus that causes 
 AIDS, through sexual intercourse is very low.
 The Ministry reported the case on Wed 1 Oct 2003 to a panel on blood supply 
 services that oversees emergencies. The Ministry is investigating the cause 
 of infection and trying to ascertain whether any of the 8 blood donors are 
 HIV-positive, officials said. Stored blood samples from the 8 donors have 
 been re-tested using a screening system even more sensitive than the 
 ordinary NAT, according to the Japanese Red Cross Society, which oversees 
 the nation's blood donation programs.
 None of the samples tested positive for HIV, Red Cross officials said. But 
 it is possible the virus went undetected because the viral load was too low 
 at the time of donation, maybe because the donor had only recently 
 contracted HIV, officials said. Blood plasma from 3 of the 8 donors has 
 already been used on 3 other patients, one of whom later died of an 
 unrelated illness. The other 2 patients are being tested for infection. 
 Blood plasma from the remaining 5 donors has not yet been used.
 [It still seems far from conclusive that the patient did in fact contract 
 HIV via transfusion of contaminated blood. This report was obtained by Dr. 
 Trofimov via the Drug Use and HIV/AIDS News Digest of the Asia Harm 
 Reduction (AHR) Network. - Mod.CP]
