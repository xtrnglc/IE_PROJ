 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Press briefing Tues 25 Mar 2003, 10h00
 World Health Organization
 Dr David Heymann, Executive Director, Communicable Diseases
 Dr Klaus Stohr, Scientist, CSR
 Dr Julie Hall, Medical Officer, CSR
 Mr Dick Thompson, Communications Officer
 Dr David Heymann: We are now 10 days into an outbreak of what we believe is 
 a previously unrecognized disease in humans. We have cases that have spread 
 out of Hong Kong and Viet Nam, throughout the world, and we have a 
 laboratory group which has identified 2 different viruses in patient 
 specimens. a paramyxovirus and a coronavirus. At the same time, we�ve done 
 epidemiological studies which, to date, have shown us that most if not all 
 cases can be identified in a chain of transmission from the patient back 
 somehow to a family member or to a contact directly with a hospital worker 
 or with a hotel in Hong Kong.
 As of now we still maintain that travel is not to be interrupted throughout 
 the world. But as you know there�s much, much information coming out of 
 Hong Kong, and there�s been a rapid increase in the number of cases this 
 week, and we are in regular contact with Hong Kong and with our Regional 
 Office in Manila and we will be reconsidering today our travel 
 recommendations as we do every day.
 Today we will be with a group of industrialized countries that have cases 
 as well as the countries in which the majority of cases are occurring in 
 Asia. So we�re at the end of a 10-day period which has seen a remarkable 
 working together of scientists, epidemiologists and countries in the world 
 to better understand and stop the spread of what we believe is a previously 
 unrecognized infectious agent.
 Dr Klaus Stohr: 8 days ago, WHO established a network of 11 laboratories in 
 9 countries. Now 8 days later, these 11 laboratories in these 9 countries 
 have found already 2 very strong contenders, 2 viruses which are 
 consistently isolated from many patients from very many different countries.
 The research is ongoing. It is not normal that one disease is caused by 2 
 viruses. We will have to strengthen the activities, particularly as far as 
 electron microscopy is concerned, as well as genetic analysis.
 Dr Julie Hall: WHO is working very closely with all its partners in the 
 Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. We�ve been able to produce 
 guidance based on clinical and epidemiological evidence posted on our web 
 site on the SARS page.We�ve established a logistic basis throughout the 
 world and worked in close collaboration with bilateral arrangements from a 
 variety of different countries to ensure that supplies are in place. We 
 also have 3 field teams in place.
 In Hanoi there are 9 people who have been there since 14 Mar 2003. Their 
 key focus has been on infection control and where infection control has 
 been put in place and has been practised effectively, we have seen a 
 dramatic reduction in inter-hospital and community transfer of this agent. 
 They have also been working hard in terms of clinical management, and we 
 now have a large data set of information about this syndrome which will 
 help us to understand its clinical cause and possible effective treatments. 
 It�s been shown that good supportive care has been effective, and we are 
 now in a position in Viet Nam where, now that we have developed a discharge 
 policy, a number of patients are likely to be discharged from hospital in 
 the very near future.
 In Hong Kong we have a 5-person team that has been focusing on 
 epidemiological research and has provided a lot of data in terms of how 
 this infectious agent has been transferred and transmitted between people 
 and what infection control measures are required. A 5-person team arrived 
 on Sunday in China. They have a remit [permit?] to review the 
 epidemiological data that�s been collected by the Chinese authorities and 
 also to help support the microbiology and virology investigations into this 
 outbreak. So there has been an unprecedented collaborative effort, and all 
 the institutions that are working in the various forms, whether it be in 
 the field teams, in the clinical network, or in the laboratory network; the 
 details of all of those are on the sheets at the back if people want to 
 look at those.
 Q. When I look at the latest figures from the WHO, it is really worrying 
 because it seems to me that only in Hong Kong, the figures kept increasing 
 and we have now 10 deaths. What are the factors that make Hong Kong so 
 special? It seems the situation is not under control.
 A. Dr David Heymann: Our teams are also concerned about the situation in 
 Hong Kong because of its spread in many different hospitals, and our team 
 there is working with the government in Hong Kong, not only to better 
 understand what�s going on in Hong Kong as far as the epidemiology or the 
 transmission of the disease, but also in trying to stop the spread of the 
 disease. There are people who are infection control experts working in the 
 government and with the government to try to make sure that we can stop 
 this outbreak. I just need to remind you though that at present there is no 
 evidence that there is any transmission other than close contact with 
 patients, either sitting next to patients or being in close contact with 
 patients. But this adds to the urgency in Hong Kong to make sure that this 
 remains true in the studies that are found because now, as you know, there 
 are cases in schools, there are cases other places, and we need to make 
 sure that if there are other cases in schools, they aren�t cases that are 
 randomly occurring but are cases which sat next to students who were sick. 
 And the same goes for airplanes, if there are airplanes that [transported] 
 someone who�s sick, we would want to be sure that it was people sitting 
 next to that person and not the ventilation system in the aeroplane which 
 was spreading the disease. We have no evidence of the latter right now, but 
 this is why studies are so important and why we reinforced our team to work 
 with the very excellent teams in Hong Kong to find out what�s going on for 
 sure.
 Q. A couple of questions. I assume you are supportive of the mass 
 quarantine that Singapore authorities have announced that they are starting 
 today. Singapore today began ordering hundreds of people to stay at home 
 and it�s being described as the world�s largest quarantine. They are making 
 use of the Infectious Diseases Act, which is the first time they�ve ever 
 used it. So (a) are you in favour of measures like that? and (b) my second 
 question is, when you were talking about the travel advisory, you seemed to 
 stress there�s no new advice for the present. But are you expecting this 
 might change after the meeting with industrialized countries today?
 A. Dr David Heymann: The first is that WHO puts out recommendations on 
 travel but it�s countries who make the final decision based on their 
 legislation and their national laws. That�s why we�re meeting with 
 countries today, because other countries have the same concerns as 
 Singapore. And we�re trying to work with them to better understand the 
 basis for their concerns. The recommendations of WHO are always 
 evidence-based. That means that when we get evidence that suggests that we 
 should be changing a policy, we move to change that policy. We�ve been 
 meeting on a regular basis by telephone with many countries. Today we will 
 bring all those countries together to discuss travel recommendations. And I 
 will say what I would say every day, that we leave it open that if there is 
 new evidence with which we can make a better policy or a different policy, 
 we will do that and we will not hesitate to do it. So, our recommendations 
 will be evidence-based and we do not make a recommendation if there�s no 
 evidence to support that. This many times occurs in national contexts 
 because there are rules or laws which require them to judge on the side of 
 safety rather than on the side of non-safety, if you understand what I�m 
 saying. So, yes there�s always a chance that WHO will change its 
 recommendations and we will keep you posted if that should occur.
 Q. With Singapore, I presume that you are in favour of measures taken, such 
 as those in Singapore � mass quarantine?
 A. Dr David Heymann: Governments take a decision based on the conditions 
 locally. If for some reason Singapore feels that they will not be able to 
 trace all cases because there�s such great mobility in their populations 
 that they must make restrictions on them, then that�s what they�ve decided 
 to do. Our recommendation is that there be no restrictions at present. But 
 that�s a global recommendation. And again, that�s being reconsidered on a 
 daily basis and will be re-considered today at 2.30 pm in our conference call.
 Q. The question about the 2 viruses having been, or 2 families of viruses 
 having been associated with this disease or with this outbreak. You said it 
 was not normal, if I�m not mistaken. Could you give us an idea of whether 
 or not it�s possible for a single disease to be caused by 2 viruses or is 
 it more likely that at least one of the samples might not be related to SARS?
 A. Dr Klaus Stohr: Speaking as a scientist, we are looking at a very 
 interesting and a fascinating situation. Looking from the point of 
 infectious disease control, we are a bit puzzled because we are not only 
 dealing apparently with one pathogen but with 2. The reason why we believe 
 that both pathogens should be given equal attention is that there is 
 consistent finding of both pathogens in individual patients or of either of 
 the pathogens in other patients. What we are seeing actually are 3 
 hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that one of the viruses, for instance 
 the corona virus, causes the disease, and that might be a new corona virus. 
 The second hypothesis is that the paramyxoviruses cause the disease and if 
 that was the case, it�s certainly also a new paramyxovirus. The third 
 hypothesis, very obviously, is that these 2 pathogens have to come together 
 to cause this very severe outbreak. One of the viruses, for instance the 
 coronavirus, is known to live in immune cells, cells which are important 
 for defense against infection. So what one could hypothesize is that this 
 coronavirus destroys or at least diminishes the immunity in the patient so 
 that the second virus has practically an open door to go in and to sicken 
 the patient beyond what this virus would be able to do normally.
 Dr David Heymann: Let me just add to that: there could be a fourth 
 hypothesis. It is possible that both are common viruses: one found in all 
 the patients, even though it's not causing disease, and the other will be 
 the disease-causing agent, so they could both be found but not be related 
 in any way, just there by chance. So it's a very complicated issue that's 
 being sorted out.
 Q. In China, is the team in Beijing getting new figures on how many cases 
 we have in China? Also, can they go to Guangdong or will they just remain 
 in Beijing doing that kind of laboratory service?
 A. Dr David Heymann: Yesterday the team in China had a question from the 
 Government, and that was "why is WHO not putting on its web site the 305 
 cases that we reported?" The answer was because we only started recording 
 cases from 1 Feb 2003, and we don't know how many cases China had from 1 
 Feb 2003 on. That made the Chinese believe that they needed to go back and 
 look at their data, and they've promised us they would do that and give us 
 more information. Today that information has not come out yet. Our team has 
 met with officials from Guangdong and from Beijing but the information is 
 not yet available, but we have reason to believe that it will be made 
 available and that there is very much interest in Beijing by the 
 international press on these issues as well as by the press from outside 
 Beijing.
 Q. Is the team going to Guangdong?
 A.Dr David Heymann: The team has not yet been invited to go to Guangdong 
 and we don't know whether that invitation will be coming. Certainly our 
 wish would be that the Government will permit us to work with them in all 
 aspects of this outbreak.
 Q. Do you think it's advisable for the team to go to Guangdong to help 
 investigate what's going on? Did WHO request specifically that they should 
 go to Guangdong?
 A. Dr David Heymann: WHO has requested the Government to let the team work 
 with them as best it possibly can, and we would hope that that would 
 include working in Guangdong as well as working in Beijing.
 Q. I have 2 questions. My first is that there is a lot of hypothesising 
 about the first case of the outbreak, a lot of media reported that it was 
 the Chinese businessman who came back from China who went to Hanoi who was 
 the one who was dead in Hong Kong. Do you have any information about the 
 first case? Secondly, can you clarify the route of transmission. Is it 
 possible to have transmission by air?
 A. Dr Julie Hall: We have quite a lot of information about the gentleman, 
 what we are calling the "Hanoi index case", the Chinese-American 
 businessman who went to Hanoi, became unwell, and was then transferred to 
 hospital in Hong Kong. He was transferred in isolation and treated in 
 isolation as well once he got to Hong Kong. The team in Hanoi are currently 
 following up his travels prior to arriving in Hanoi. It seems that he 
 travelled quite extensively prior to becoming unwell and prior to arrival 
 in Viet Nam. Further details on that are currently being sought by our team 
 so that we can follow his travels in the 2-3 weeks prior to his becoming 
 unwell in a little more detail. Obviously, when somebody becomes unwell in 
 one country, lives in another country, and is then transferred for care in 
 a third country, it does take a while for all this detailed information to 
 be put together.
 Dr David Heymann: To date, in looking at every case that occurs, it has not 
 been possible to say that there was not close contact with another patient, 
 be it a family member of a hospital worker, a hospital worker, or one of 
 the initial cases. Now that information comes in on a daily basis. If, and 
 the minute we find that there are cases which cannot be traced to close 
 contact with another patient or another person at risk, we will then be 
 very concerned that this might have become airborne. Airborne meaning that 
 you would be at risk sitting where you are. The way it is today that we 
 believe from the evidence we have, the only person at risk in this room 
 would be Dr Stohr, who's sitting next to me. But if we find that you are at 
 risk, we will immediately have to consider a whole series of new measures 
 to recommend and the studies will have to intensify to find out how it's 
 circulating more widely than just by person-to-person contact.
 Q. From what I understand from the end of last week, you were becoming more 
 confident that you had this under control. But the data this week seems to 
 show the opposite. How confident are you that you've got it under control? 
 How concerned are you that it could be getting worse instead of better?
 A. Dr David Heymann: When we made the global alert 10 days ago, our goal 
 was to stop outbreaks occurring in other countries than Hong Kong and Viet 
 Nam because of imported cases. We knew that Canada had had imported cases 
 and had had local transmission within Canada. If you look at the global 
 alert, it has brought in reports of disease from many different countries - 
 13 I believe is the latest count - and there have been no additional 
 outbreaks in those countries. So the global containment exercise has been 
 successful to date. The exercise of containing the disease in Viet Nam 
 appears to have been successful, there has been a slowdown in new cases, 
 hospital infection control has been strengthened in hospitals, and it 
 appears that that outbreak has been contained in Viet Nam. In Singapore, 
 where there were imported cases, there appears to now have been a closing 
 in on contacts of patients, and we believe that the situation in Singapore 
 is being controlled. In Hong Kong there is a very difficult situation and a 
 different situation in that 10 hospitals are now involved. It is a very 
 important exercise to contain the disease in these 10 hospitals. We also 
 know that people have been in schools who have become sick, so there is 
 where the efforts must be now intensified in addition to better 
 understanding what is going on in China. So we have 2 countries in which we 
 are very concerned now -- Hong Kong -- and in finding out more about what 
 is going on in China, because those are the 2 countries where we have less 
 information and we are less sure that containment activities are being 
 successful.
 Q. For the incubation period of the disease, WHO said that it was 2-5 days 
 or 2-7 days. In Hong Kong, however, the doctor was in close contact with 
 the patient 11 or 12 days before. So people are now concerned whether we 
 should play safe and extend the incubation period so that the virus won't 
 spread even further. Do you have any information and recommendation on this?
 A. Dr Klaus Stohr: Thank you. The incubation period is the period between 
 the infection, when the patient gets in contact possibly with the pathogen, 
 and when the first clinical signs occur. Now that is a very important 
 period of time because it tells us presumably that during this period of 
 time the person can start spreading the virus. The incubation period in 
 Hanoi, from the data which has been collected during the first two weeks of 
 the outbreak, the average incubation period is 4.5 days. The minimum 
 incubation period is 2 days. The maximum incubation period is 7 days. Very 
 similar data were forthcoming from Singapore, with a minimum 2 days, 
 maximum 7 days. We are talking about a biological phenomenon and we cannot 
 rule out that there have been slightly shorter or slightly longer 
 incubation periods. However, we have also to realize that not every contact 
 of a doctor with a patient must necessarily lead to an infection, so even 
 if there has already been contact between the doctor and the patient over a 
 period of time, perhaps the infection took only place 4 or 5 days after the 
 contact began and the doctor started incubating. We are looking at a new 
 disease. We are looking at possibly 2 different viruses, so we really have 
 to cautious in drawing generic and absolute conclusions. The data that we 
 have are relatively firm 2 days to 7 days and we have to take more data and 
 analyse them, and these data are going to be collected particularly from 
 Hong Kong and particularly in Hanoi, but there will be analytical 
 information perhaps as you describe, but that has to be verified.
 Q. Now we have 10 days of the global alert, can we say what of the number 
 of cases known, what the mortality percentage is?
 A. Dr Julie Hall: It has remained pretty static over the last 10 days, it's 
 around about 4 percent mortality rate. So it's quite low and we haven't 
 seen any change in that mortality rate over the 10 days.
 Q. In that case is it really such a horrible scourge that's menacing the 
 world, because normally influenza has that kind of mortality rate doesn't it?
 A. Dr David Heymann: I would differ I would say that this is not a low 
 mortality rate, we want zero mortality rate. This is a 4 percent mortality 
 in a disease for which we do not yet know the cause. So it's a very serious 
 issue in having a 4 percent mortality in a disease for which we don't yet 
 know the cause and which is spreading throughout the world. 4 percent is a 
 level of mortality that could be equivalent to other viral infections in 
 many parts of the world. It's equivalent of what might be occurring with 
 West Nile, it's probably more than what is happening with West Nile in 
 North America.
 Dr Klaus Stohr: The low mortality rate is perhaps also being contributed to 
 by the enormous clinical efforts taken with those patients. In one hospital 
 in Hong Kong there are more than 150 patients, almost 30 of whom are in 
 intensive care. Quite a few of them are on ventilators; they would die 
 without mechanical ventilation. The health system is burdened almost to the 
 limit in quite a few of the hospitals, and we of course have to look at the 
 case mortality rate and morbidity but also at the burden on the public 
 health system, which is enormous.
 Dr David Heymann: And just to put one more thing in perspective. Suppose 
 that there were 2 diseases occurring at the same time, SARS and a disease 
 which causes the same symptoms but is less severe. It my be that this 
 second less severe background disease, caused by another virus, would cause 
 a different case fatality rate. We can only begin to distinguish genuine 
 SARS cases from other less severe diseases having similar initial symptoms 
 when we have a diagnostic test. So we're still far from understanding 
 everything.
 [Rather than be critical of changing interpretations and explanations, 
 readers should be reminded that this is a new disease process, a truly 
 "emerging infectious disease" about which we have many questions and few 
 definitive answers.  We are very early in our identification of this 
 outbreak, the etiology is still unknown, and the epidemiology is still 
 being defined as more cases are identified and investigated.  In our quest 
 for "transparency" in investigations, the price we pay is early release of 
 very preliminary findings that with further investigation and study are 
 disproven or disqualified.  Hence, if these preliminary results were not 
 released, there would be criticism that too much was "secretive".
 As reiterated in the above press statement, to date all indications have 
 been that transmission of SARS requires close contact with active cases of 
 SARS, and that generalized spread in the community has not been 
 detected.  Almost all cases identified to date can specifically trace their 
 exposure to another case of SARS, either in the health care environment, 
 the family or other social environment, or in the Hong Kong tour group 
 (close contact with an individual who sat next to a probable case who had 
 visited a hospitalized case). - Mod.MPP]
 [The statement "It is not normal that one disease is caused by two viruses" 
 is not strictly true. Satellite viruses and satellite nucleic acids which 
 may influence virulence and transmissibility have been described for 
 viruses infecting insects and plants, but not for vertebrate viruses with 
 the exception of hepatitis B virus and delta virus.  A more modest and 
 defensible conclusion would be that on the basis of  current evidence it is 
 possible that neither of these 2 candidate etiologic agents are 
 determinants of SARS. Paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses are fairly benign 
 ubiquitous residents of the human respiratory tract that might be detected 
 fortuitously in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. - Mod.CP]
