 New case of laboratory-confirmed SARS in Guangdong, China - update 5  
 31 Jan 2004
 --------------------------
 A new case of laboratory-confirmed infection with the SARS coronavirus 
 (SARS-CoV) has been reported today by the Ministry of Health in China. This 
 is the 4th case (3 confirmed and one probable) detected in China since 16 
 Dec 2003.
 The new case is a 40-year-old director of a hospital and practicing 
 physician from Guangzhou, Guangdong Province who developed symptoms of SARS 
 on 7 Jan 2004. He was admitted to a hospital in Guangdong with pneumonia on 
 16 Jan and placed in respiratory isolation on the suspicion of SARS. He has 
 made a full recovery and was discharged home on 30 Jan 2004.
 In accordance with WHO recommendations for SARS-CoV testing in the inter-
 epidemic period 
 <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/guidelines/en/WHOSARSReferenceLab.pdf>, the 
 results of SARS-CoV testing performed at the national reference laboratory 
 in Beijing were verified by a WHO SARS International Reference and 
 Verification Network laboratory in Hong Kong.
 At present, the source of infection in this most recent SARS case is 
 unknown. The Ministry of Health is conducting an epidemiological 
 investigation into possible sources of transmission and has carried out 
 contact tracing and other public health measures. To date, none of the 
 contacts so far identified has developed symptoms of SARS. The Ministry is 
 also collaborating with WHO China Country Office to further investigate 
 this and the other recent SARS cases in Guangdong province. See Review of 
 probable and laboratory-confirmed SARS cases in southern China 
 <http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_27/en/>.
 WHO will continue to closely monitor the situation in Guangdong.
 [This is now the 4th case of SARS reported in China (i.e. 3 laboratory 
 confirmed, one probable case -- see references below).  Of note, this case 
 is in a health care worker, which may suggest that this individual was 
 infected in the health care environment.  In the outbreak in Guangdong 
 reported in February 2003, the proportion of SARS cases in health care 
 workers was approximately 30 percent.  In the final analysis of the global 
 outbreak, approximately 21 percent of SARS cases reported in 2003 were in 
 health care workers, with a high of 43 percent reported in Canada -- see 
 The Consensus Document on the Epidemiology of SARS 
 <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf>.
 From a seasonal perspective, the outbreak of SARS in 2003 became apparent 
 with reports of 305 cases in Guangdong in early Feb 2003 (see ProMED-mail 
 posting from 10 Feb 2003 Pneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI20030210.0357).  
 Investigation of that outbreak identified the probable 1st case of SARS with 
 a date of onset of illness on 16 Nov 2002.  Looking at the epidemic curve of 
 the 2003 outbreak (Fig. 2, page 18 of the above-referenced Consensus 
 Document), there were apparently "sporadic" cases of SARS with dates of onset 
 in the period November/December 2002 followed by increases in numbers of 
 cases in January 2003, when there were several cases a day followed by an 
 increase in cases reported in the last week in January and the first week in 
 February 2003.  
 This "season" there have been 3 apparently sporadic cases reported during the 
 period December 2003/January 2004, all associated with rapid implementation 
 of appropriate infection control procedures.  We await information on the 
 epidemiologic investigation of this 4th case to see whether the case is 
 associated with possible transmission in the health care environment, 
 signalling that possible additional cases may not have come to the attention 
 of the formal health sector reporting units.  While the numbers in 2004 are 
 still very small, they bear an intriguing similarity to 2004's pattern.
 All 4 of these reported cases to date have been associated with a mild 
 illness and full recovery.  This is a small number of cases from which to 
 draw any real conclusions, but all 4 were in individuals less than 50 years 
 of age.  According to the final analyses presented in the above-mentioned 
 Consensus Document (Table 3 page 14), the age-specific case fatality rates 
 reported in China were 0.9 percent for those 20-29 years of age, 3.0 
 percent for 30-39 years, and 5.0 percent for 40-49 years. - Mod.MPP]
