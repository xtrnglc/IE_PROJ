 Notes:
 Cumulative number of cases includes number of deaths.
 As SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may
 change over time. This means that previously reported cases may be
 discarded after further investigation and follow-up.
 A decrease in the number of cumulative cases and discrepancies in the
 difference between cumulative number of cases of the last and the current
 WHO update are attributed to the discarding of cases.

 [C]  Update 57 - Situation in China, guidance for mass gatherings,
 stability of the SARS virus, more than 600 deaths globally  16 May 2003
 <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_16/en/>
 China has today reported 39 new probable SARS cases and 4 new deaths,
 bringing the cumulative total to 5191 probable cases and 275 deaths.
 Beijing reported 28 probable SARS cases today, on the sixth consecutive day
 that the city has reported less than 50 probable SARS cases. From the last
 week of April 2003 through 3 May 2003, Beijing was reporting a daily
 average of more than 100 probable cases. The daily number of new deaths has
 also declined from a peak of 15, reported on 22 Apr 2003, to an average of
 4 during the past week. Beijing reported a single death today.
 WHO experts interpret the decrease in case numbers as encouraging, but have
 cautioned against concluding that the city's SARS cases were on a downward
 trend. They warned that misdiagnosis of cases could have contributed to the
 lower numbers of probable cases in recent days. WHO officials fear that
 patients with milder symptoms of SARS are being excluded as probable cases.
 The number of wrongly diagnosed patients is not known, but WHO experts
 became concerned that this could be happening after recent visits to
 Beijing hospitals.
 "They fit the case definition but because they get better in a few days,
 they are not seen as probable cases," explained Dr Daniel Chin, leader of
 WHO's Beijing team of SARS experts.  "Clinicians are making this decision
 because there's an assumption that SARS patients must be very sick. But
 there's a [wide] spectrum of severity for SARS."
 Clinicians were also basing their decision to exclude patients as probable
 SARS cases [solely on the patient's report of no] known previous contact
 with a SARS case -� a definition used in areas with few SARS cases. Given
 the relatively large number of SARS cases in Beijing, such a criterion
 cannot be used, Dr Chin said.
 He added that this was occurring due to confusion over the case definition,
 not because clinicians were trying to hide cases. WHO has asked the Beijing
 Government for a taskforce to be convened to address this issue.
 Dr Chin said patients with milder SARS symptoms must be treated with all
 the same precautions.  "It is still possible that they are not SARS cases,
 but without a reliable test, we can't confirm that," he said.
 Patients with milder symptoms start off being isolated as suspect cases.
 But after their condition improves, they end up being sent to general
 medical wards, where they could infect other patients. Others may be sent
 home too early.  "They may not need to be hospitalized, but they could still
 be infectious," Dr Chin said.
 A study of clinical progression in 75 SARS patients, published in today's
 Lancet by a Hong Kong laboratory in the WHO network, describes 3 clinical
 stages in patients from the Amoy Gardens cluster. In the mostly uniform
 3-stage pattern, the first week of illness was characterized by fever,
 myalgia, and other symptoms that generally improved after a few days. In
 the second week of illness, when infectivity is greatest, patients
 frequently experienced recurrence of fever, diarrhoea, and oxygen
 desaturation. In this study, 20 percent of the patients progressed to a
 third phase, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome
 necessitating ventilatory support.
 Health authorities and clinicians need to be aware of these 3 phases of
 illness. In terms of preventing further spread, including nosocomial
 transmission, it is dangerous to relax precautions prematurely, notably
 isolation and infection control, following clinical improvement during the
 first week of illness.
 Guidance for mass gatherings was issued by WHO yesterday in response to
 concern that persons travelling to large events from areas with local
 transmission of SARS might pose a risk to other attendees in the host
 country. The recommendations, which are issued as global guidance and are
 based on a risk-benefit analysis, are in line with WHO efforts to prevent
 the further international spread of SARS while also protecting the
 travelling public from unjustified restrictions. See Guidance for Mass
 Gatherings: hosting persons arriving from an area with recent local
 transmission of SARS
 [<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/guidelines/gatherings/en/>]
 The purpose of the recommendations is to help hosting governments and
 organizers of such events make decisions that protect domestic populations.
 Such decisions are left to the authority of individual countries based on
 their own assessment of the nature of the event, the potential for exposure
 of the general population should a case of SARS occur, and the capacity of
 the country's public health infrastructure to cope. Capacity includes
 pre-existing arrangements for surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation
 --� in other words, capacity for managing the situation should someone
 attending the event become ill with SARS.
 WHO has today published additional data on the stability of the SARS virus
 on different environmental surfaces. See: First data on stability and
 resistance of SARS coronavirus compiled by members of WHO laboratory
 network. [<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/survival_2003_05_04/en/index.html>]
 The data, which come from studies conducted by laboratories in the WHO
 network, indicate that the SARS virus in *sterilized* stool can survive for
 36 hours on a plastered wall or a formica surface, for 72 hours on a
 plastic surface or stainless steel, and for 96 hours on a glass slide.
 As of today, a cumulative total of 7739 probable SARS cases and 611 deaths
 have been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 54 new
 cases and 13 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in
 China (4), Hong Kong SAR (4), and Taiwan, China (5).
 Data on the daily reports of cases by province, probable cases, suspected
 cases, health care worker cases, number of deaths, number of cases
 discharged from the hospital, and dates of last reported cases (probable
 and suspected) can be accessed at the above WHO link.
 There have been a total of 5191 probable cases reported to date, of which
 952 (18.3 percent) have been in health care workers (in the past 24 hours,
 3 of the 39 (7.7 percent) new probable cases have been reported in health
 care workers). In the 24-hour period covered by this update, new probable
 cases were reported from Beijing (28), Guangdong (2), Hebei (2),  Jilin
 (1), Shanxi (1), Sichuan (2), and Tianjin (3).  An additional 2173
 suspected cases have been reported from the affected provinces. No cases
 (probable or suspected) have been reported from Guizhou, Hainan, Qinghai
 [but see news brief below - Mod.MPP], Tibet, Xinjiang, or Yunnan.
 There are a total of 275 deaths reported due to SARS, of which 4
 were newly reported in the past 24 hours [one each in Beijing, Hebei,
 Shanghai & Tianjin. - Mod.JW]
 Of the 39 probable cases reported in the past 24 hours, 29 were previously
 reported as suspected cases.  Of the 28 reported in Beijing, 22 were
 previously reported as suspect cases, and 11 previously reported probable
 cases were excluded, of which 2 were reclassified as suspected cases. In
 Hebei, both of the newly reported probable cases had been previously
 reported as suspected cases.  In Shanxi, the one newly reported probable
 case (reported in the past 24 hours) had been previously reported as a
 suspected case.  In Sichuan, both of the newly reported probable cases had
 been previously reported as suspected cases.  In Tianjin, of the 3 newly
 reported probable cases, 2 had been previously reported as suspected cases.
 Case reports were received from 31 provinces/autonomous
 regions/municipalities.

 The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
 Hospital Authority:
 As of 1 PM 16 May 2003, 3 additional patients have been confirmed to have
 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) following admission to public
 hospitals. They include one healthcare worker from Prince of Wales Hospital
 and 2 who are other patients and contacts of patients with SARS.
 A total of 1171 patients have recovered from SARS and have been discharged
 from public hospitals. Of them, 11 were discharged today. There are now 232
 active cases under treatment in hospitals, of whom 52 patients are in
 intensive care units. In addition, 65 are recovering patients in
 convalescence and in preparation for discharge.
 4 patients died. This brings the total number of deaths attributable to
 SARS to 238. The deceased include 3 men and one woman aged 53 to 90.
 The cumulative numbers of patients who have been admitted to public
 hospitals with SARS since 12 Mar 2003 are as follows:
 Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged patients/ total no. deaths/
 total no. patients in hospital
 (change in past 24 hours presented in parentheses with minus sign used for

 Suspected cases 14
 * There are 65 recovering patients in convalescence.
 In the 16 May SARS bulletin (can be accessed at:
 <http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm> there is a discussion on the 234
 reported SARS related deaths.
 About 71 percent of the SARS-related deaths were in individuals with
 pre-existing medical illnesses, such as hypertension, heart diseases,
 diabetes mellitus, or stroke.  There is a table presenting the proportional
 age and sex distribution of the reported deaths. The male-to-female ratio
 is 1.7 to 1.   63 percent of these deaths were in individuals 65 years or
 older.
 There are no new probable cases, discharges, or deaths reported today. The
 number of patients who have recovered from SARS is 157, with 19 patients
 still hospitalised, 7 in intensive care.
 There are currently 32 inpatients and 12 staff from IMH warded at the [Tan
 Tock Seng Hospital] TTSH for observation of fever. They are all in stable
 condition. The patients are from Wards 64, 65, 35, and 50B. 3 more staff
 were discharged today, bringing the total number of staff discharges from
 the IMH cluster to 8. These staff were discharged as they had no fever for
 more than 48 hours.
 So far, PCR testing for coronavirus has been negative in samples taken from
 21 patients. Of 9 patients who were tested, 6 were positive for influenza B
 virus. As investigations are still in progress, the IMH cluster will
 continue to be managed as a SARS outbreak.
 There were no new suspect cases admitted today.  One case previously
 admitted for observation has been re-classified as a suspect case today
 based on positive travel history to Taipei.
 In addition to the IMH cluster, one patient was admitted for observation
 today.
 **Discharged patients under home quarantine:
 498 (including 20 patients discharged from IMH)
 Contacts under home quarantine:
 305 (including 295 related to IMH cluster)
 Total under home quarantine: 803
 *Quarantine cases refer to those who are required to stay at home for
 precautionary reasons as they may have had contact with a SARS patient.
 These are healthy individuals.
 ** This is an added precautionary measure for discharged SARS patients as
 well as those with co-morbidities.

 [A] China, Quinhai from the Times of Tibet May 14, 2003, 13:15
 <http://www.timesoftibet.tibetsearch.com/artman/publish/article_1335.shtml>
 Zhao Bingli, head of the supervision group and deputy minister of the State
 Population and Family Planning Commission, admitted that, due to the poor
 medical infrastructure in the TAR [Tibetan Autonomous Region], with
 extremely limited medical resources and  "short supply and relatively low
 quality" of medical personnel, should the epidemic enter Tibet,  "the
 consequences will be too ghastly to contemplate".
 There are no known cases of SARS so far in the TAR. Other Tibetan regions
 seem also to have been spared to date. 2 alleged cases have been reported,
 one at a military hospital and the other at the Minorities University, both
 in Xining, the capital of Qinghai province (known to Tibetans traditionally
 as Amdo), but these have not been confirmed and therefore do
 not appear in official statistics.
 [B] Taiwan/Japan travel from The Yomiuri Shimbun
 <http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/20030517wo31.htm>
 A doctor from Taiwan who returned to Taipei after a tour of western Japan
 this week is suspected of having the SARS virus, Taiwan health authorities
 said Friday.  The 26-year-old man has been quarantined in Taipei for a
 checkup to determine whether he has been infected with the virus, according
 to the authorities.   According to the Japanese Health, Labor and Welfare
 Ministry, the doctor's condition is not yet known because the hospital he
 was admitted to has been shut down and cannot be contacted.  The doctor
 works at a hospital in Taiwan where SARS infection has been discovered, and
 he was treating SARS patients there.
 On 8 May 2003, he arrived in Osaka from Taipei on a Japan Asia Airways
 flight as a member of a package tour. On 13 May 2003, he flew back to
 Taipei.  According to an itinerary prepared by a tourist agency, the
 members of the tour visited Osaka, Kyoto and Himeji, Hyogo
 Prefecture.  They also visited the Shikoku region via Shodoshima island. It
 is not known whether the doctor visited all these places.
 67 passengers, including 9 Japanese, and 19 crew members, including 12
 Japanese, were on the flight to Taiwan, JAA said.  The Taiwan authorities
 are working to determine whether any passenger or crew member has been
 infected with the SARS virus.  According to JAA, all crew members are in
 Taiwan now, and none have developed fevers.
 According to the Friday [16 May 2003] issue of a Taiwanese daily, the
 doctor had a fever on 9 May 2003. However, he took medicine that reduced
 the fever, the paper added.  On Friday night, the Health, Labor and Welfare
 Ministry started investigating the physical condition of employees and
 guests at hotels where the doctor in question had stayed during his trip in
 western Japan.
 [As of 16 May 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 7739 probable
 cases of SARS with 611 deaths reported to WHO.  In the past 24 hours there
 have been 54 newly reported probable cases, of which 39 were from China, 10
 were from Taiwan, 3 were from Hong Kong, and 2 were from the United States.
 In [1][C] Worldwide - WHO there is a very interesting discussion of
 possible misdiagnosis of milder presentations of SARS with the potential to
 increase transmission of the disease if infection control isolation
 procedures are not adhered to, especially in the hospital setting. On a
 similar line of reasoning, earlier on in this outbreak, this moderator
 speculated whether one outcome of the SARS outbreak would be that health
 care personnel would add respiratory protection as a routine precaution
 when evaluating febrile respiratory illnesses in patients.  In the pre-HIV
 days, health care personnel did not routinely apply universal precautions
 to prevent contact with bodily fluids of patients, even though the risk of
 transmission of diseases in the health care environment was there (it was
 well recognized that transmission of hepatitis B did occur from patient to
 health care worker and in reverse).  Given the severity of the illness
 associated with SARS, (and epidemic/pandemic influenza), the addition of
 respiratory precautions when evaluating febrile respiratory illness seems
 as logical as universal precautions does with respect to contact with
 bodily fluids.
 The febrile respiratory outbreak in the Institute of Mental Health of
 Singapore is being thoroughly investigated and monitored.  As mentioned in
 the Ministry of Health update [5], 21 patients were negative for
 coronavirus by PCR testing, and 6 out of 9 tested were positive for
 Influenza B.  As mentioned in an earlier posting, this is a reminder that
 there are other etiologies for febrile respiratory illness outbreaks.  As
 an aside, there was a newswire today mentioning an influenza A outbreak in
 Shenzhen, yet another reminder of other etiologies for febrile respiratory
 illness outbreaks.

 thanks to Stephen Apatow  <s.m.apatow@humanitarian.net>).
 In the news brief section there was an article in the Times of Tibet
 mentioning 2  "alleged" cases in Xining, the capital of Quinghai
 province.  No information on these cases is provided in the daily updates
 from the Chinese Ministry of Health, suggesting either a need for further
 clarification or just an unfounded rumor that has been ruled out.  More
 information on this would be appreciated.
 The news brief also contains information on a possible (suspect vs.
 probable) case of SARS in a physician from Taiwan who became ill while
 touring in Japan.  The information contained in the newswire demonstrates
 the rapid communication ongoing between countries.  At the same time, it
 highlights the realities that we now live in a global village with rapid
 communication and transport that potentially facilitates the
 "transportation" of diseases between countries.  According to WHO
 guidelines issued yesterday -- seehttp://www.who.int/csr/sars/guidelines/gatherings/en/,if it is correct
 that the physician involved had been working in a hospital that was
 involved in SARS transmission in Taiwan, and therefore may have been in
 contact with SARS cases, the physician should not have left Taiwan for 10
 days following possible exposure to suspected SARS patients ("A person who
 has been in close contact or thinks he or she has been in close contact
 with a person suspected of SARS over the last 10 days, should not leave
 his/her country and should contact the national health authorities of his
 /her country.   If however, the person has already left his/her country, he
 or she should contact the Medical Service of the hosting Organization /
 Institution in the country to be placed under active surveillance for 10
 days after the date of his/her contact with a case and according to the
 standardized procedures of the hosting country." )
