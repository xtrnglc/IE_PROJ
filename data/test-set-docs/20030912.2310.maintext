 I noted the critical remarks on ProMED regarding the performance of the FAO 
 World Reference Laboratory for Rinderpest (WRLR), Institute for Animal 
 Health, Pirbright in testing the warthog samples submitted from Mauritania. 
 Perhaps I can clarify the situation.
 Initially we were sent 2 serum samples (6 months after collection) which 
 had been tested previously by 3 African Laboratories and found to be 
 positive for antibodies to rinderpest. We found these samples to be 
 negative for rinderpest but positive for PPR. Almost 3 weeks later we were 
 sent 2 different serum samples along with an apology for sending us the 
 wrong samples the first time. These proved to be rinderpest-positive, as 
 expected. Our cumulative results now agree with those of the African 
 Laboratories.
 The WRLR can only provide a rapid, accurate diagnostic service if the 
 correct samples are submitted as quickly as possible. The question remains 
 as to how these warthogs have antibodies to rinderpest virus, when there 
 have been no reports of rinderpest in West Africa during the lifetime of 
 these animals.
 [The moderator comments referred to were: "Note that the warthog serum 
 samples were collected in January 2003; that laboratories in 3 different 
 African countries tested the sera, and found 2 rinderpest positives which 
 Mauritania reported to OIE on 17 Jul 2003; that the UK reference laboratory 
 reported the samples negative for rinderpest but positive for peste des 
 petits ruminants (PPR) antibodies on 22 Jul 2003 (see refs. below), but the 
 same laboratory confirmed rinderpest positivity after all on 7 Aug 2003; 
 and that this report was received by OIE on 21 Aug 2003."  While factually 
 correct, the information on the actual samples provided to Pirbright was 
 not available at the time of posting. We are glad to be able to put this right.
 As to Dr. Anderson's comment on rinderpest in Mauritania, the OIE 
 Handistatus data shows that the previous official reports of this disease 
 were for 1987 -- and then in cattle, not wildlife.  As we have frequently 
 noted, while pathogens are frequently reported, the reporting of diseases 
 is sometimes subject to various filters, unfortunately. - Mod.MHJ]
