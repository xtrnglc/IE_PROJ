 With reference to the previous posting [see reference below], I would like 
 to add to comments made by the moderator.
 We confirmed the presence of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) on the island of 
 Mauritius in October 2000 by electron microscopy of lesion material. They 
 have been vaccinating cattle on the island but have recently been 
 considering the effect of discontinuing this.
 [Thanks to Dr Gerdes for her complementary information.
 According to Mauritius' reports to the OIE, the outbreak in 2000 was due to 
 importation of cattle from a country on the African continent. 178 clinical 
 cases were recorded, of which 2 animals died. The outbreak was eradicated 
 by application of slaughter policy followed by general vaccination. No 
 cases have been reported during 2001-2003. - Mod.AS]
