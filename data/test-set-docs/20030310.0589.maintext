 An outbreak of dengue fever in South Sulawesi over the past 2 months has
 killed at least 23 people and hospitalized 546 others, signaling the
 possibility of an increase over last year's 38 deaths, a local health
 official said on Tue 4 Mar 2003.
 Dengue fever has affected almost all regencies and cities in South Sulawesi,
 said the head of the province's health office, Akib Kamaluddin. "The
 likelihood is that the number (of victims) will increase, since not all
 cities and regencies have reported to
 us on the dengue fever situation in their areas," Akib said, adding that 15
 out of 25 regions had yet to file reports. He said the highest number of
 reported dengue fever cases had been recorded in the province's capital
 city, Makassar, where 12 had died and 289 others fallen ill.
 In 2002, the total death toll amounted to 38 compared to 23 in the first 2
 months of 2003. Akib attributed the rise to ineffective efforts to fight the
 disease, which is spread via the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. Despite the
 outbreak of dengue fever, the public still had a low awareness about
 environmental cleanliness measures to prevent the mosquitoes from breeding,
 he explained. Spraying and fumigation had made the mosquitoes resistant to
 pesticides, and so far there were no drugs or vaccines to counter the
 disease, he said. "So, the only thing we can do is to rely on prevention
 measures like emptying, filling in, or covering places where water can
 accumulate," Akib said.

 Dengue fever cases are on the rise in the Paraguayan city of Pedro Juan
 Caballero on the border with Brazil, where around 20 cases of the disease
 have been reported. On 21 Feb 2003 the city, separated by a street from its
 Brazilian twin Ponta Pora, reported 3 cases of dengue virus type 3, in
 contrast to the dengue virus serotype 1 normally recorded in this region,
 leading Paraguayan authorities to impose an epidemiological alert.
 Since then, Carlos Maria Romero, who heads a task force working to eradicate
 the disease, stated that 18 new cases have been reported in this region.
 Dengue sufferers were being treated on an outpatient basis.
 Another case was recorded in Luque, a municipality near Asuncion, and still
 another in the province of San Pedro, north of the capital, Romero said.
 In Paraguay, dengue became an endemic disease in 1999, when there were more
 than 600 000 cases of dengue virus type 1 infection, although no fatalities
 were reported. A prevention and awareness campaign carried out by the Health
 Ministry succeeded in drastically bringing down the number of cases to
 slightly more than 100 in 2002.
 In Cairns, Australia, 3 locally acquired cases of dengue fever have been
 confirmed. Dengue serotype 2 has been confirmed in one of the cases (Brian
 Montgomery, Scientific Officer, Tropical Public Health Unit, Queensland
 Heath, personal communication, Wed 5 March 2003).
 All 3 patients are residents of Cairns and became ill in mid February 2003.
 One of them also had a connection with Mareeba (approximately 40 km west of
 Cairns) during the infectious period (1). The primary case has not yet been
 identified, and there is a possibility that more people may be infected in
 Cairns or Mareeba. The Dengue Action Response Team (DART) is carrying out
 extensive mosquito surveillance and eradication in line with the protocols
 established in the Dengue Fever Management Plan for North Queensland
 2000-2005 (2).
 Dengue is not endemic in Queensland, but the mosquito vector _Aedes aegypti_
 is common in north Queensland. Sporadic outbreaks occur when the virus is
 introduced via international travellers or residents returning from endemic
 countries, most typically Asia and the south Pacific. There have been 3
 large outbreaks of dengue in north Queensland since 1992, all
 originating from imported cases; one in Townsville (1992-3), involving 900
 cases, one in the Torres Strait and Cairns (1996-7), involving 208 cases,
 and the third in Cairns, Mossman, and Port Douglas (2000), involving 498
 cases (2).
 Prevention of dengue focuses around avoidance of mosquito bites. Advice to
 European travellers to Queensland would include the use of an appropriate
 insect repellent (containing Diethyltoluamide (DEET)) and to wear
 long-sleeved shirts and long trousers to limit skin available for bites.
 _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes bite during the day (particularly around dawn
 and dusk) and may be found both outdoors and indoors. Spraying rooms with a
 knockdown insecticide and using an electrical pyrethroid vaporiser will help
 to control mosquitoes indoors. Air conditioning also tends to make
 mosquitoes less active. Sleeping under an impregnated mosquito net will
 minimise mosquito bites from dawn onwards.
 All travellers to Australia should take measures to prevent bites to protect
 themselves against other mosquito-borne diseases such as Ross River virus,
 Barmah Forest virus, Kunjin virus, and Murray Valley Encephalitis.

 3 new cases of (classic) dengue fever have been reported from places close
 to Guayaquil, Ecuador.
 According to hospital director Ricardo Giler, during January and February
 2003, 37 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been reported nationwide, 16
 of them from Guayaquil.  There have been no deaths.
 An outbreak of dengue fever and chikungunya disease has claimed the lives of
 13 people in Cirebon, West Java, over the past 2 months, a local health
 official said on Sat 8 Mar 2003.
 Dadang Prihadi, the Head of the Cirebon Health Office, said that at least
 315 people in the regency were infected with the mosquito-borne diseases.
 "Over the last 2 months we have recorded 216 cases of dengue fever and 99
 cases of chikungunya," said Dadang. "The patients who died were those who
 didn't get medical treatment in time," he said.
 Dengue fever is spread by _Aedes aegepti_ mosquitoes, while chikungunya is
 spread by _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes. To curb the diseases, he said, the
 Health Office has been running an integrated mosquito extermination
 operation. "The regent also instructed us to do that immediately," he added.
 Dadang said the administration had fumigated 23 out of a total of 36
 districts in the regency. He said that by mid-March [2003] they would have
 completed fumigations in all 36 districts, including those where there were
 no cases of dengue fever or chikungunya.
 "April and May will be the peak of a 5-year cycle of the [dengue] outbreak,"
 he said. Out of the 36 districts in the regency, 3 districts (Batu Belah,
 Klangenan, and Karangsari) are most prone to dengue fever. He added that
 based on the 5-year cycle, this year would be the peak of the cycle. In
 comparison to previous years, this year's number of cases of dengue fever is
 higher.
