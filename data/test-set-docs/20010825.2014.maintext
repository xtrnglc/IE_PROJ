 West Nile virus confirmed in Oakville blue jay
 ----------------------------------------------
 .
 OAKVILLE: A dead blue jay found in Oakville has tested positive on 
 confirmatory testing for West Nile virus at the Federal Laboratory in 
 Winnipeg. "Initial testing had shown signs of the virus. Further tests 
 confirm that the bird was infected with West Nile virus," said Dr Bob 
 Nosal, medical officer of health, Halton Region Health Department. To date, 
 2 birds have tested positive for the virus in Southwestern Ontario -- one 
 in Windsor and one in Oakville. The virus has not been detected in humans.
 As a result of the confirmatory tests, mosquito traps will be set up in 
 Oakville early next week. Residents should continue to protect themselves 
 against mosquito bites and report dead crow and blue jay sightings to the 
 Health Department. In addition, it is very important to prevent mosquitoes 
 from breeding around homes.
