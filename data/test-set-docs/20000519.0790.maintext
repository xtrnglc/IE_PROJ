 The presence of _Rickettsia mongolotimonae_ in a second patient in France
 appears to confirm the presence of this rickettsia in France.  All
 sequences from the organism isolated from biopsies from the eschar shared
 100% similarity with _R. mongolotimonae_ when compared with GenBank data. 
 It is not surprising in this age that the discovery of eight new
 rickettsioses was made in the last thirteen years.  Due to advances in
 genetics more and more new species or strains of a species are going to be
 discovered.  These findings are of great epidemiologic interest.  It shows
 that a given spotted fever rickettsia is not localized to a specific
 geographic region.  Recognizing the syndrome by the clinical community is a
 major issue since it was pointed out that the  "symptoms differed markedly
 from those of the first".  These differences in clinical symptoms make the
 clinical diagnosis of rickettsiosis even more difficult then it already is.
  As a result, physicians should rule out rickettsiosis by laboratory means
 in all patients with fever of unknown origin that do not present with the
 "classical" symptoms in areas known to be endemic.
