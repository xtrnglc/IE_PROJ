 Texas state agencies are closely monitoring what may be the largest
 concentration of red tide in the Gulf of Mexico since 1986 when a strain
 passed through the area, killing more than 22 million fish in a 4-month
 period. 
 Dave Buzan, spokesman for the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife Kills
 and Spills Team, said locally, the algae have reached high enough
 concentrations to be seen by
 the naked eye and cause respiratory irritation in humans.  
 The current outbreak already has resulted in millions of dead fish, he
 said.  "We do not have an accurate number yet," said Buzan. "But we are
 estimating several million fish have been killed so far." 
 According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife daily Internet update, biologists
 observed red tide on Sunday in the Corpus Christi Bay near the downtown
 area. They also observed red tide in the Oso Bay and near the Port Aransas
 jetties. Since Labor Day weekend, streaks of the algae were spotted in the
 Gulf of Mexico near Galveston and in the
 west end of Matagorda Bay. 
 Buzan said one visible bloom off Matagorda Bay appeared on Sept. 18 and
 now spans more than a 70-square-foot area.  "It is so big it can be
 detected on satellite imagery," Buzan said. 
 Red tide is a high concentration of microscopic algae producing a toxin,
 affecting the central nervous system of fish and killing them. While the
 fish kills usually consist of schooling species, such as mullet and
 menhaden, the algae has a domino effect on other marine life. 
 "Some (fish) do not die from red tide," said Wes Tunnell, director of the
 Center for Coastal Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. "They
 die from lack of oxygen." 
 Blooms, or high concentrations, usually come up along Gulf beaches and
 less frequently into bays and estuaries. They can become so dense the
 water turns a reddish-brown and causes the oxygen levels in the water to
 drop far below normal. Usually, smaller fish die off first, but larger
 fish suffer as their food supply dwindles, Tunnell said.  
 The toxins can become airborne, causing human respiratory problems such
 as respiratory nose, throat and eye irritation. 
 The Department of Health also warns people can get neurotoxin shellfish
 poisoning from eating clams, mussels, whelks and oysters contaminated by
 red tide. 
 The department warns the public against harvesting for personal
 consumption. Red tide poison symptoms include nausea and dizziness
 lasting for several days. Seafood such as crab, shrimp and fish should be
 safe from contamination. 
 In Galveston Bay, commercial harvesting of oysters has been shut down
 since Sept. 5 because of red tide. The Texas Department of Health's
 Seafood Safety Division officials are monitoring the situation locally to
 see if similar restrictions will need to be issued in the Coastal Bend.
 Oyster season doesn't open in Corpus Christi until November. 
 "We will be looking to determine if it is safe to open for oyster
 season," said Kirk Wiles, director of Seafood Safety. "We will have to
 see if there are any problems at that time."
