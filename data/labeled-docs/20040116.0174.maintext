 Researchers say there is a lot to learn about a flu-like disease from 
 Flinders Island that has made its way to mainland Tasmania. Flinders Island 
 spotted fever, which is a strain of rickettsiosis [_Rickettsia honei_], has 
 been found in ticks feasting on snakes. The disease is transmitted to 
 humans through tick bites.
 Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery snake expert Jane Guy says 
 researchers are yet to identify the initial carrier of the disease. "We'll 
 be very interested to find out whether the ticks that are carrying the 
 rickettsia are getting it from the snakes or whether they're giving it to 
 the snakes via their blood," Ms Guy said.

 [Flinders Island is located in the Bass Strait between Victoria and 
 Tasmania. Its spotted fever was first reported in 1991, when 26 cases were 
 identified over 17 years in the population of about 1000 (1). Like most 
 rickettsioses, it is characterized by fever, headache, myalgias, 
 arthralgias, and a maculopapular rash. A majority also have focal skin 
 lesions. Serological studies placed the illness in the spotted fever group. 
 Genetic analysis of the isolated organism as compared to other rickettsia 
 led to its designation as _R. honei_ (2). _R. honei_ was subsequently found 
 to be very closely related to TT-118, a tick typhus organism isolated in 
 Thailand as early as 1962 (3). _R. honei_ has also been isolated from 
 cattle ticks _Amblyomma cajennense_ in Texas, USA (3).
 In Australia, _R. honei_ has been isolated from humans as well as from 
 _Aponomma hydrosauri_ ticks taken from various reptiles including 
 blue-tongued lizards (_Tiliqua nigrolutea_), tiger snakes (_Notechis ater 
 humphreysi_), and copperhead snakes (_Austrelaps superbus_) on Flinders 
 Island (3). Vertical transmission via transovarial spread seems to maintain 
 the organism in the ticks (4,5). In one study, 63 percent of 46 ticks were 
 found to harbor _R. honei_, but none of 17 reptiles did (4). Some of the 
 infected ticks were from the mainland of Tasmania itself.
