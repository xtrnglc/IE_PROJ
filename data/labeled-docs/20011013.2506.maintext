 Public Health Dispatch: Acute Flaccid Paralysis Associated with Circulating
 Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus --- Philippines, 2001
 Three cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with circulating
 vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) isolates were reported in the
 Philippines during March 15--July 26, 2001. The first case-patient, a child
 aged 8 years from northern Mindanao island (500 miles south of Manila) who
 had received 3 doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV), had onset of paralysis on
 March 15. A second child, aged 3 years from Laguna province on Luzon island
 (60 miles south of Manila) who had received 3 OPV doses, presented with
 signs of meningitis but no paralysis on July 23. A third child, aged 14
 months from Cavite province (25 miles from Manila and 45 miles north of
 Laguna province) who had received 2 OPV doses, had onset of paralysis on
 July 26. No patients had traveled outside of their province of residence
 since birth. Characterization of isolates from the 3 patients revealed
 type 1 polioviruses derived from Sabin vaccine strain type 1, with a 3%
 genetic sequence difference between Sabin 1 vaccine and vaccine-derived
 poliovirus (VDPV) isolates. The 3 polioviruses are not identical but
 are closely related (99% sequence homology); they also appear to share an
 identical recombination site with a nonpolio enterovirus in the noncapsid
 region of the genome.
 Following cVDPV outbreaks in the Dominican Republic and Haiti (Hispaniola)
 during 2000--2001 (1), the global polio laboratory network implemented
 additional testing requirements for all polioviruses under investigation,
 prospectively and retrospectively. Both an antigenic-based (ELISA) and a
 molecular-based test (probe hybridization) are used to determine whether a
 poliovirus is wild or derived from vaccine (i.e., intratypic
 differentiation [ITD]). Divergent ITD results (one test showing
 vaccine-derived and the other wild-type virus) for any poliovirus isolate
 now require genomic sequencing of the suspect isolates. Retrospective
 testing of 2000 vaccine-related isolates from AFP cases globally has
 revealed no additional cVDPVs, although testing results of other isolates
 in the laboratory network are pending. The cVDPVs from the Philippines were
 detected after the implementation of new testing requirements for
 prospective virus investigations.
 In response to these cases, the Department of Health in the Philippines 1)
 enhanced surveillance by active record review for AFP cases in hospitals
 and other health-care facilities in the affected and neighboring provinces,
 2) established surveillance to conduct virologic investigations of aseptic
 meningitis at major health-care facilities, 3) collected stool samples from
 healthy contacts of case-patients, 4) conducted field investigations of
 clustered AFP cases to determine the extent of cVDPV circulation, and 5)
 assessed polio vaccination coverage in these communities. The
 investigations have found no unreported cases, although some AFP cases
 remain under investigation. To interrupt cVDPV circulation, a large-scale
 mass vaccination campaign with OPV is planned.
 Low routine vaccination coverage is one of the most important causes of
 VDPV. Because the location of the originating events is unknown, the
 contribution of other factors is difficult to assess; however, a
 combination of 2 concurrent events within the virus is necessary for
 cVDPV emergence: reversion of attenuating mutations to increase
 neurovirulence, and a presumed increase in transmission characteristics
 that might be related to recombination with a nonpolio enterovirus. The
 molecular basis for the second property is not understood.
 Wild poliovirus was last reported in the Philippines in 1993 (2), and
 national vaccination rounds were last conducted in the Philippines in 1997
 followed by subnational immunization days in 1998 and 1999. Among the areas
 covered were Cebu, Davao, Manila, and parts of Mindanao; however, coverage
 did not extend to the 3 provinces now reporting cVDPV cases. Routine
 coverage with 3 OPV doses has been approximately 80% nationwide since the
 early 1990s; however, coverage gaps are likely, particularly in slum areas.
 Travelers to the Philippines should ensure that they are vaccinated
 appropriately against polio according to national recommendations (3).

 [This is now the third documented episode of poliomyelitis-like illness
 (acute flaccid paralysis - AFP) due to circulating vaccine derived
 poliovirus (cVDPV) with reversion to neurovirulence.  The 2 prior
 episodes were on the island of Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti)
 and in Egypt (see referenced ProMED-mail postings above).  In addition,
 there were reports of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus in Israel
 identified in sewage sampling but not associated with clinical illness
 (also reported in above ProMED-mail postings).
 One wonders if this is a case of "seek and ye shall find" or if this is an
 emerging problem associated with the disease.  The former seems to be
 preliminarily ruled out by the failure of a retrospective study of over
 2000 AFP associated poliovirus isolates to identify additional VDPV, albeit
 if it is a low level occurrence, we may miss it by virtue of the rarity of
 the event.   If the latter is the case, one wonders why now, after
 approximately 50 years of use are we seeing this phenomenon.   If one
 rejects the reference of "approximately 50 years of use" and chooses to
 further refine the date to when increased vaccination activities associated
 with the polio eradication effort began, then the time frame for widespread
 use is approximately 16 years, when polio eradication activities in the
 Americas region began.
 Of note is that this has occurred in 3 different regions of the world
 -- the Middle East (Egypt and Israel), the Americas (Hispaniola) and now in
 the Western Pacific (Philippines).   In 2 areas (Hispaniola and the
 Philippines) circulation of the wild poliovirus had been interrupted (the
 last reported case of wild poliovirus associated disease in the Americas
 was in 1991 and in the Philippines in 1993).
 In the absence of total interruption of wild poliovirus circulation
 world-wide there is still a need to keep up intensified vaccination efforts
 as the risk of disease is still present, especially in today's environment
 with extensive travel world-wide.  The occurrence of cVDPV in association
 with clinical disease is very disturbing as it adds another factor into the
 risk benefit equation of vaccination recommendations.  As mentioned in an
 earlier comment, a cost-efficacy analysis of switching to the inactivated
 vaccine (inactivated polio vaccine - IPV)  in countries that have
 interrupted wild virus circulation probably negates the economic viability
 of such a recommendation.  In addition, and not an insignificant addition
 is that a switch to the IPV would remove the advantage of flooding the
 environment with the vaccine virus (the attenuated very low-neurovirulence
 virus) to further interrupt transmission of wild poliovirus if introduced
 as well as to "vaccinate" individuals who may not have directly taken the
 vaccine themselves. - Mod.MPP]
