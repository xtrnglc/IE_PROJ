 Sheep with signs of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) have been found at an
 abattoir at Gaerwen on the island of Anglesey, Wales. There is some
 confusion about whether or not the diagnosis is confirmed in these
 sheep. The 7am news said it was confirmed while the 8am and 9am news said
 it was suspected/under investigation. There are more suspected cases of
 FMD under investigation in Aberdeenshire and Gloucester. 
 In the UK, the Devon farmer whose farm was outbreak 7, which was
 confirmed yesterday, says he has not exported any livestock since
 suspected infected sheep brought the virus onto his farm. The sheep had
 been traded at Hexham Market and subsequently traveled from the north
 east of England to Devon. 
 In Germany the animals imported from Britain are being destroyed in
 North-West Rhein Westfalia.
 The UK Agriculture Minister, Nick Brown, is due to travel to Brussels
 today to discuss the situation with other EU farm ministers. He will also
 make a statement in Parliament his afternoon.

 Chairman of the National Farmers' Union East Anglia branch, Dan Squier,
 today criticized the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF)
 for the delay in the burning of the pigs. 
 Mr Squier, spokesman for the farm's owner John Morley, said: "Nothing is
 happening. They haven't got the materials to make the fire. If there is a
 major outbreak I wonder whether the system will be able to cope. That is
 what worries me. The pigs are still there and [we] want [them] to be
 disposed of as quickly as possible so the risk of the infection spreading
 is minimized. I call on MAFF to get on with it. It's high time for them
 to be disposed of." 
 Animals slaughtered on a farm next door to the establishment suspected of
 being the source of the FMD outbreak did have the infection, veterinary
 surgeons confirmed today. The confirmation came as agriculture minister
 Joyce Quin and MAFF chief veterinarian Richard Drummond held a joint
 briefing in Northumberland. 
 Three royal parks -- including the home of Princess Alexandra -- will be
 shut to stop FMD spreading to deer herds, officials said today. The
 shutdown, from midnight tonight, will stop public access to Richmond
 Park, Bushy Park and Hampton Court Home Park, all in south west London. 
 Restricted access would be granted to residents, including Princess
 Alexandra, who would only be allowed to use certain gates and must use
 disinfectants before entering the parks. The deer herds have bloodlines
 dating back to the reign of Henry VIII and the decision was taken to
 prevent them catching the disease, which has threatened to cripple
 Britain's agriculture industry.

 Beleaguered UK farmers will lose an estimated 51 million [BPS] during the
 week-long ban on transporting animals vulnerable to Foot and Mouth
 Disease (FMD). They will not be able to market an estimated 47 000 prime
 cattle, 228 000 pigs and 323 000 sheep. That means they will lose out on
 expected sales of 22 million for prime cattle, 16 million for pigs and 13
 million for sheep. 
 Seven British sheep appearing at France's annual agricultural fair were
 given the all-clear after blood tests for FMD, a food safety spokesman
 said Saturday. Blood samples from the sheep passed 2 separate tests, the
 spokesman said. The sheep were shown at an official British stand at the
 fair. 
 French authorities have located some 47 000 British ovines imported in
 the past 30 days and are monitoring them, the ministry of agriculture
 said. 
 Belgium banned the movement of sheep and goats Saturday as a precaution
 against FMD outbreak in Britain, the agriculture ministry announced. The
 ban is effective immediately and for an indefinite duration, ministry
 spokesman Jaak Gabriels said. The ban had been imposed because "the
 situation in the United Kingdom is not under control as new sources of
 the disease are appearing," and tracing animals which may already have
 come from Britain is still incomplete, he said. "Therefore we don't want
 to take any risks."

 Limited exemption to the suspension of Great Britain livestock movement
 (1.16pm, 25 Feb 2001) 
 The Ministry of Agriculture today (Sunday, 25 Feb 2001) announced limited
 exemptions to the 7-day total prohibition of livestock movements imposed
 to ensure the containment and eradication of FMD. From 6pm on Saturday,
 24 Feb 2001, any animal which has: died on the premises on which it was kept;
 or been slaughtered for animal welfare reasons; may be moved from the
 premises on which it is to a rendering plant, knacker's yard or a hunt
 kennel. Such movements are subject to stringent conditions to minimize
 any risk of disease spread. 
 The ministry also issued a licence on Friday, 23 Feb 2001 permitting animals
 caught at markets, fairs or collection centers at 5pm that day when the
 control area in England and Wales came into force, to return to the
 premises of the owner or purchaser, or move direct to slaughter.

 Outbreak 12 has been confirmed on a farm in Okehampton, Devon Abattoir in
 Anglesey. The diagnosis still not clear. The case was a 1 year old lamb,
 lame and with lesions around the mouth. Abattoir under police guard. Delay
 in diagnosis may be good news - negatives take longer than positives. 
 Incineration pyre is under construction at Prestwick farm, Northumberland,
 close to Newcastle airport.

 25 000 animals exposed to foot and mouth at 3 marts (6.15pm, 26 Feb 2001) 
 After sheep dealer Willy Cleave of Burdon Farm, Highampton, Devon, got
 FMD on his farms in the West Country - probably as a result of a link
 with the Waugh brothers swill-feeding farm at East Heddon in
 Northumberland - and before the disease became apparent, he had dealings
 with Hexham, Longtown (Carlisle) and Northampton marts. 
 This means 25 000 animals may have been exposed to FMD as they passed
 through the 3 markets. 
 Livestock Auctioneers' Association chairman Peter Kingwill is reported as
 saying 12 000 sheep and 200 cattle pass through Longtown market in a
 typical week, whilst Northampton sells 6000 sheep, 1000 pigs and 300
 cattle, and Hexham handles 5000 sheep and 1000 cattle. Germany takes
 rigorous preventative measures 
 (6pm, Feb 26) Reports from Germany indicate all the stops are being
 pulled out to identify and deal with recent livestock imports from
 Britain. 
 About 3500 sheep have been imported into Germany since 20 Jan 2001.
 Veterinarians will check some 3000 British pigs on 20 farms in Lower
 Saxony for FMD.  The 350 imported sheep (reportedly from Burden Farm,
 Highampton, Devon) have already been slaughtered. Carcass tests in
 Germany have not found FMD, so far. Officials will consider slaughtering
 all flocks containing sheep imported from Britain in the last 4 weeks. 
 (5.30pm, Feb 26) Total number of outbreaks of FMD has risen to 12. The
 latest case is linked to a farm in Okehampton, Devon. The cases reported
 thus far today appear to have clear links, or likely links, with the
 Northumberland source of the disease and/or the west country Highampton
 outbreak. 
 Nick Brown has told the Commons at lunchtime a decision was taken to kill
 the remaining animals on several premises in Devon under the same
 ownership as Burden Farm, Highampton, and one neighboring farm. 
 The German state of North Rhine-Westphalia has begun destroying animals
 imported from Britain as a precaution against Foot and Mouth Disease,
 regional agriculture minister Baerbel Hoehn said Monday. 
 Speaking on Deutschlandradio, she said the destruction was carried out on
 1 farm Sunday and that another 1 was due to follow Monday. The action was
 taken because animals imported into the German state from Britain in
 January included some coming from a British farm where the
 highly-infectious disease has broken out. 
 [Regarding a previous ProMED-mail posting, it states: "The Home Office
 instructed all police forces to keep watch for the illegal movement of
 livestock. The ban applies to cattle, pigs, sheep and goats, but not to
 horses, poultry, milk, cereal, vegetables or animal feed."]
  I believe milk tankers were implicated in past outbreaks as a means of 
 spread of  FMD virus between farms. There was evidence milk from dairy
 farms, in the incubation stage or [frp, animals] showing no clinical
 signs, was spread to other farms by milk tankers in the following way.
 Aerosols are created when milk is added to milk tankers. Air is displaced
 during the milk loading process and creates aerosols capable of being a
 source of spread of FMD virus through the dispersal of infected milk
 particles picked up from a previous infected dairy or dairies where the
 disease was incubating. 
 Also, it is a maxim that diseases are spread by the "movement of animals,
 people and 'Things'. 
 There is a fast growing population of South American Camelids in the UK,
 particularly alpacas. South American Camelids are reported to be
 experimentally and naturally susceptible to Foot-and-Mouth disease. 
 There is a great deal of movement of animals for breeding purposes. The
 MAFF ban on animal movements within the UK does not mention these species
 of animals, but it is my opinion it should. 
 [The FMD outbreak appears to be enlarging; sheep are now involved. 
 The disease can be spread by �things� as well as by animal movement.
 Trucks may well spread the disease, and in previous post it was noted
 MAFF requested all non-essential individuals and vehicles to refrain from
 being in the banned area farms. It seems as how milk tankers would be
 included.
 Furthermore, camelids are apparently in the ban and it may be a media
 oversight since this has not been mentioned. � Mod.TG]
