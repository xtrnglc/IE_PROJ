 _Stachybotrys chartarum_ (Ehrenb. ex Link) S.J. Hughes was isolated from 
 surface-disinfested soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) root lesions. The 
 fungus was cultured on potato dextrose agar, and its morphology was 
 examined by light and environmental scanning electron microscopy. 
 Conidiophores were determinate, macronematous, solitary or in groups, and 
 simple or irregularly branched. Phialides occurred in whorls and were 
 obovate or ellipsoidal. Conidia were unicellular, round to ellipsoidal, 5 
 to 13 � 4 to 7 �m, initially hyaline, smooth-walled, and dark brown to 
 black and rough-walled when mature. A pure culture obtained from infected 
 soy-bean roots was used to test pathogenicity under greenhouse and 
 growth-chamber conditions. _S. chartarum_ was grown on sterilized sorghum 
 grain for 2 weeks and placed in soil 2 to 3 cm below sown soybean seeds. 
 Noninfested sorghum grain was used as a control. All soybean plants 
 inoculated with _S. chartarum_ had root lesions ranging from 7 to 25 mm 21 
 days after sowing, while control plants did not have any measurable root rot.
 The DNA sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was 100% 
 identical to _S. chartarum_ strain ATCC 9182 (1) but differed from all 
 published sequences of other _Stachybotrys_ and _Memnoniella_ spp. in 
 Gen-Bank (1). Polymerase chain reaction with _S. chartarum_-specific primer 
 StacR3 and IT51 (1) amplified a 198-bp DNA fragment from the total genomic 
 DNA. The molecular evidence further supports the identification of _S. 
 chartarum_ isolated from soybean.
 This is the first report of _S. chartarum_ causing soybean root rot.

 [_Stachybotrys chartarum_ also causes disease in humans and animals through 
 the action of a number of mycotoxins, including trichothecenes. The fungus 
 also produces 9-phenylspirodrimanes and cyclosporin which are potent 
 immunosuppressive agents. Two good references can be found at the following
