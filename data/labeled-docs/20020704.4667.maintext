 Anthrax outbreak under control in Zimbabwe: official
 ----------------------------------------------------
 .
 HARARE: Zimbabwe's Department of Veterinary Services said here on Tuesday 
 that an anthrax outbreak that occurred recently in the Dendenyore area of 
 Mashonaland East Province is now under control. "The outbreak was an 
 isolated one and all livestock in the area are being vaccinated against the 
 disease," said the department's director, Stuart Hargreaves.
 The department, Hargreaves said, had enough anthrax vaccines as it recently 
 imported about 500 000 doses. He urged farmers to report any case suspected 
 to be anthrax to veterinary officers in their respective areas. About 3 
 weeks ago 2 people were reported to have contracted the anthrax disease at 
 Dendenyore after eating meat from an infected cow.
 [Livestock anthrax hypoendemic (consistent small numbers of cases and not 
 the randomness associated with the term "sporadic") in Zimbabwe, and the 
 problem is made worse by the human consumption of such animals. In 2000 and 
 2001 there was a limited number of livestock cases but over 900 people were 
 affected. The 2 cases reported here were probably those with the worst 
 clinical signs, with perhaps another 5 to 8 more with diarrhea and 
 abdominal pain. - Mod.MHJ]
