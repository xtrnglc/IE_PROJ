 A Significant Difference in the Cuban & Tanzanian Neuropathy Outbreaks
 --------------------------------------------------
 .
 During the Cuban neuropathy outbreak in 1992-1993, we worked [in 
 collaboration with the team investigating] the theories concerning a 
 possible toxic-nutritional physiopathological origin and the [involvement 
 of oxidative stress]. Later our team, with French research partners, 
 developed different prospective studies (the SECUBA program 1995 ï¿½1997) in 
 healthy volunteers and patients with neuropathy, [establishing] the central 
 role of antioxidants, energy, and oxidative stress in the Cuban neuropathy 
 outbreak.
 We were aware of the Tanzanian epidemic of bilateral optic neuropathy 
 (Dolin PJ, Mohamed AA, Plant GT. Epidemic of bilateral optic neuropathy in 
 Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. N Engl J Med 1998;338:1547-8). [Although] the most 
 recent information is limited, [a significant difference between the Cuban 
 and Tanzanian outbreaks] is that no deaths occurred in the Cuban neuropathy 
 outbreak. Nonetheless we are always interested in assisting any country, 
 including Tanzania, [that suspects the occurrence] of an epidemic 
 neuropathy outbreak of the type experienced in Cuba.
 In Cuba the disease is no longer a problem, and the solution was related to 
 improvements in diet, particularly antioxidants [supplied] by vegetables 
 and fruits, even if the [overall] levels of calories and some [other] 
 nutrients (e.g., B vitamins) were not entirely adequate. Lifestyle was also 
 important.
 [Dr Verdura's comments may refer to 2 separate events, namely the outbreak 
 of epidemic neuropathy in the coastal region of Tanzania and an outbreak of 
 an unidentified illness affecting mainly young men on Ukerewe Island, 
 Tanzania. I have edited Dr Verdura's remarks (I hope correctly) to relate 
 mainly to the first of these 2 events. - Mod.CP]
 [Dr Verdura rightly points out that the epidemic neuropathy seen in Cuba 
 was not associated with mortality. A review of the limited postings on the 
 epidemic neuropathy in the Tanzania Coastal area does not mention mortality 
 either.  This moderator significantly erred by the provocative comments 
 made in the posting Unexplained deaths - Tanzania (Ukerewe Island) (02): 
 RFI20030529.1314, suggesting there might be a link between the epidemic 
 neuropathy reported in the coast of Tanzania and the undiagnosed deaths in 
 young males on Ukerewe Island.  A late night fruit salad mixing of apples
