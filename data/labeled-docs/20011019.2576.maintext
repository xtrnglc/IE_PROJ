 Caring for the Survivors of Uganda's Ebola Epidemic One Year On
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 Of the 257 people who survived the world's largest reported epidemic of 
 Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Uganda 1 year ago, 60 are still suffering from 
 complications of the disease. According to Paul Onek, Director of Health 
 Services in the northern district of Gulu that was hardest hit by the 
 epidemic, the complications include abdominal pains, loss of vision, loss 
 of hearing, impotence, bleeding, psychological problems, and general 
 weakness. A specialist clinic in Gulu is providing support and symptomatic 
 treatment. "About 25% of the survivors still report to the clinic. We 
 started by having as high as 50%. The number has gone down", he said. Most 
 of the survivors have become poorer because they can no longer work as much 
 as before they became ill. Some are unable to perform simple exercises such 
 as riding a bicycle.
 The first case of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Uganda was reported on 8 Oct 
 2000. Laboratory tests at the National Institute of Virology in South 
 Africa, a WHO reference laboratory, confirmed Ebola virus infection on 15 
 Oct 2000. Uganda was finally declared free of Ebola on 27 Feb 27 this year, 
 after 42 days had elapsed without any new cases.
 In total, 16 health workers, including Matthew Lukwiya, who alerted the 
 world to the epidemic, died after contracting the disease while treating 
 patients. However, the government has not yet paid compensation to the 
 health workers' families. Director-general of Health Services, Francis 
 Omaswa, blames the delay on budgetary constraints. "Ebola came in the 
 middle of the financial year and it [compensation] was not on the budget", 
 he said. He added that the ministry responsible for labour has now budgeted 
 for compensation this financial year and that the bereaved families will be 
 paid the equivalent of 5 years' salaries of the deceased health workers. 
 The 11 health workers who survived will be paid according to damages 
 suffered. "It is not something we want to go back on. We have been making 
 promises", Omaswa said.
 Ebola left 500 orphans in Uganda, a country already burdened by 1.7 million 
 AIDS orphans. Onek said the Ebola orphans aged up to 18 years old live in 
 their homes with the support of their closest relatives. They have no other 
 source of support.
 But it is not all bad news. Omaswa noted that hospitals that were involved 
 in the Ebola haemorrhagic fever epidemic now have improved infrastructures, 
 and all have had improvements made to wards. In addition, Lacor Hospital in 
 Gulu, run by missionaries, has a new laundry and ward, and Gulu Government 
 Hospital has a new laboratory.
 Sam Okware, who chaired the national Ebola task force, said Ugandan 
 scientists were following up survivors in partnership with US and German 
 colleagues. Okware said the index case and source of the Ebola epidemic 
 have not yet been established, and surveillance continues. "The environment 
 is still the same. We don't know why it came. So we think it may take its 
 natural cycle", he said.
