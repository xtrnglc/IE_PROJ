 include: Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Laboratories, Austin; El 
 Paso City-County Health Department Laboratory; City of Houston Health

 [There was a posting some time earlier this year in which I recommended 
 that horses and cattle be vaccinated for rabies. Some readers seemed to 
 think this was unnecessary. But I would ask you to note there was a horse 
 and a cow confirmed with rabies in July. Horses often eat out of your hand, 
 or your child's hand. This is a very cheap and reliable preventative for 
 this fatal disease. Cows can and do get rabies. Although not everyone hand 
 feeds their cattle, some may, especially show animals. This disease is not 
 something to toy with. It is worth the effort and the few dollars to 
 prevent this disease. -Mod.TG]
