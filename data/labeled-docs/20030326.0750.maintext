 Sunflower rust (_Helianthus annuus_ L.) caused by _Puccinia helianthi_ [Ph] 
 Schwein. is a major disease in Mozambique where local ecotypes, from 
 Peredovik and Record selections, and South African commercial varieties 
 were all susceptible to race 4, which was prevalent among isolates 
 collected from 1996 to 1997 (1).
 Disease surveys carried out in southern Mozambique (Maputo) during August 
 and September 2002 revealed an increase in the incidence and severity of 
 sunflower rust compared to previous investigations on the same varieties. 
 Rust symptoms, observed in all fields, appeared on the last leaf pairs of 
 plants at the 5.1 growth stage.
 Disease severity (percentage of leaf area infected) (2) ranged from 20 to 
 60 percent, but the disease did not cause noticeable yield loss because 
 infection started near the end of the season. Argentine and African 
 commercial varieties and some experimental Mozambican selections from 
 sunflower accessions of different origin were the most severely affected.
 2 rust samples were collected from infected leaves, stored at 5 deg C, and 
 increased on the universal suscept (S-37-388). Race identification of both 
 isolates was determined on 3 sets of 9 differential lines (3 lines per 
 set): S-37-388, CM 90 RR, MC 29; P-386, HA-R1, HA-R2; and HA-R3, HA-R4, 
 HA-R5 using the triplet coding system (3).
 2-week-old seedlings (4 per 10-cm pot) of each differential line (4 pots 
 per line) were inoculated on the upper surface of the first pair of true 
 leaves. Inoculated seedlings were covered with plastic bags, placed in a 
 growth chamber without light for 18 to 22 h, and then transferred to a 
 greenhouse under alternate day/night temperatures of 22/18 +/- 2 deg C, 60 
 to 70 percent relative humidity, and 12 h of light (180 microE�m -2 �s -1 ) 
 per day. The inoculation test was repeated twice.
 Assessment of host differential reactions, 14 days after inoculation, was 
 based on 5 categories of sunflower reaction to rust (4). Both isolates were 
 identified as race 314 and to our knowledge, this is the first report of 
 this race in Mozambique. Since Ph completes its life cycle annually, the 
 occurrence of new races is expected.
 The opportunity for new races to occur is particularly high and severe in 
 Mozambique where all sunflower varieties grown as summer (January to June) 
 and winter (August to December) crops are susceptible.

 [Sunflower rust is a constraint on sunflower production worldwide. Ph 
 infects both cultivated and wild sunflower. Teliospores overwinter on 
 infected sunflower residue and can remain viable in soil for several years. 
 Effective disease management may consist of one or more control measures, 
 including cultural practices (early planting, short-season hybrids, crop 
 rotation) and/or fungicide sprays. There are several known races (at least 
 5 in North America), and new races emerge over time. - Mod.DH]
