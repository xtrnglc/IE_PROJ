 The Texas Department of Health has confirmed that plague was the cause
 of death in a prairie dog population at Lake Meredith National
 Recreation Area. Evidence of a prairie dog die-off was investigated at
 Lake Meredith, about 30 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas on 19 Apr
 2001, raising suspicions plague could be responsible.
 Preliminary test results at the Centers for Disease Control and
 Prevention (CDC) Plague Laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado,
 identified DNA from _Yersinia pestis_ in fleas collected from the
 affected prairie dog town.
 Plague is endemic to west Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the
 disease affects rodent and rabbit populations in these areas almost
 every year. Human plague is rare, averaging only 12 cases per year in
 the USA.  Texas has had only 4 human plague cases since 1980. No cases
 of plague in humans have been reported at this time. Medical personnel
 throughout the area have been advised to watch for plague symptoms.
 Persons who have visited the park recently and have developed symptoms
 should consult their physician.
 Since the park is visited by people from outside of Texas, the medical
 community in other states should seek information regarding a visit to
 the Lake Meredith park if a patient presents with symptoms compatible
 with plague.

 [Prairie dogs are very sensitive to plague, as are domestic cats.
 Stray cats in the area, or cats that visited the park, may also show
 signs of the disease. Families having visited the park with their
 feline pets need to be on the alert for swollen areas or swollen lymph
 nodes nodes on their pets.
 There are a number of excellent flea control products available
 through veterinarians. Furthermore, pets should be examined by a
 veterinarian for any swollen lymph nodes and early signs of the
 disease ï¿½ Mod.TG]
