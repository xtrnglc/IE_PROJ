 Yellow Fever Vaccination Required For Travel to and from Easter Island
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 On 18 October 2002, the Government of Chile declared obligatory 
 vaccination against yellow fever for all persons from areas where the 
 disease is endemic. The same document (Decree No. 291) declares 
 yellow fever vaccination obligatory for all persons returning from or 
 traveling by any means to Easter Island. This administrative 
 resolution was taken because of the presence of _Aedes aegypti_ in 
 the island, and it went into effect on 8 November 2002. There have 
 been no cases of yellow fever reported in Easter Island but there 
 have been cases of dengue fever, with the Aedes mosquito being the 
 vector.
 [Easter Island is located in the Pacific Ocean 3800 km off the coast 
 of Chile. There has been no confirmed case of yellow fever on the 
 Island up to the present; the order is intended to prevent the 
 introduction of the virus into the Island.  The risk factor is the 
 presence on Easter Island of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, a vector 
 of both dengue fever virus and yellow fever virus. The presence of 
 _Aedes aegypti_ on the Island has been known for more than 2 years. 
 In March 2002 the first indication of the occurrence of dengue fever 
 virus on the Island was diagnosis of dengue fever in a patient 
 recently arrived in Chile from Easter Island (the _Aedes aegypti_ 
 mosquito was absent from mainland Chile at that time). Subsequently 
 other cases of dengue fever have been diagnosed on the Island, and 
 attempts to eradicate the mosquito vector have not yet succeeded. -

 [Since the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito can transmit both dengue and 
 yellow fever viruses, any country or territory harboring the mosquito 
 is at risk for both diseases. Therefore it is a sensible precaution 
 to require yellow fever vaccination in this case. However, given the 
 low risk of reimportation of _Aedes aegypti_ to Easter Island, it 
 would be safer, and should be feasible, to eradicate the mosquito 
 from Easter Island. If anyone has data to suggest that the risk of 
 reimportation is significant, I would like to receive it. - Mod.JW]
