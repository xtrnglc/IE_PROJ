 New outbreak in Thailand; Bird flu scare; Virus re-emerges in 9 provinces
 Newin faults fighting cocks; vet disagrees
 ----------------------------------------------
 Bird flu disease has re-emerged in poultry in 9 provinces, with officials 
 blaming unregulated movement of fighting roosters for the 2nd wave of the 
 epidemic.
 Deputy Agriculture Minister Newin Chidchob said random checks at 14 spots 
 confirmed the H5N1 strain of the flu had struck again. The check was 
 performed in 9 provinces, 8 of which had originally been declared bird flu-
 affected "red zones", marked for strict quarantine, and then been downgraded 
 to "yellow zones", marked for surveillance.
 8 provinces are experiencing a recurrence of the outbreak: Chaiyaphum, 
 Uthai Thani, Uttaradit, Sukhothai, Kanchanaburi, Nakhon Pathom, Petchaburi, 
 and Phangnga.  The 9th province, Roi Et, is having its 1st outbreak of the 
 virus.
 Newin said 10 300 samples from poultry, possible flu carriers, had been 
 collected since 12 Feb 2004 from the red zones and 427 samples from the 
 yellow zones, where movements of poultry were banned without a transport 
 certificate. He said the flu was found in 20 percent of all the samples in 
 the red zones.  In the flu-emerging provinces, the infection was present 
 mostly in fighting roosters.
 In Roi Et, the flu came from "nomadic ducks" transported to open fields to 
 graze for food such as snail pests.
 In the 8 provinces, all poultry within a 1km radius of the outbreak epicentre 
 was being destroyed.
 Newin said infected fighting roosters smuggled out of red zones during 
 the first outbreak and then brought back to the areas had probably 
 re-ignited the infection.
 In Roi Et, poultry would be culled in a 5km radius as this was the 1st time 
 the flu had been reported in the province. A poultry movement ban was also 
 imposed.
 Some owners have refused to slaughter their prized fighting roosters.
 Newin expected the latest culling operation to take no more than 72 hours.
 Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra downplayed fears of the re-emerging flu, 
 saying the government would carry out 3 spot checks every 21 days after the 
 initial outbreak to ensure the virus was eradicated.  He said the 1st 
 quarantine period may not root out the infection but subsequent rounds 
 would do the trick.
 Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, who oversees the flu situation, 
 said the fact the disease had returned in the same red zones showed the 
 viral spread had been contained.
 Jiroj Sasipreeyajan, of Chulalongkorn University's faculty of veterinary 
 science, said the detection of the bird flu virus in yellow surveillance 
 zones was due to the failure to eradicate all fowl in the epidemic area.  
 Birds in their natural habitats should also be culled, not just chickens, Dr 
 Jiroj said.  The Ministry of Agriculture needed to work more closely with the 
 Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment, he said. 
 He did not believe the reappearance of the H5N1 strain in Thailand would 
 damage the nation's credibility in dealing with the bird flu epidemic. 
 Concealing a report on bird flu discovery was more shameful than it being 
 detected again, Dr Jiroj said. A 2nd round of detection was not unusual for 
 such a highly infectious virus. He disagreed with the Ministry of 
 Agriculture's assertion that owners of fighting cocks were to blame.
 [If birds smuggled from an infected zone to a non-infected zone are the 
 reason the non-infected zone becomes infected, the smuggler is responsible 
 for the infection. It does not matter whether their occupation is raising 
 layers or fighting cocks, it is the smuggler who is responsible. The 
 motivations in this case are likely related to fighting -- either actually 
 fighting the birds or acquiring their genetics.
 Newcastle disease in California in 2003 was associated with fighting cocks; 
 now the issue is Avian Influenza in fighting cocks. How may cases of Avian 
 Influenza in humans have been associated with cock fighting?
 Certainly, these regions in Thailand will have to be very diligent in the 
 surveillance of this disease. � Mod.TG]
 The National Institute of Animal Health has confirmed that the dead 
 poultry, a cluster of suspected victims of the second outbreak of Highly 
 Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Oita Prefecture, had been "infected with 
 influenza virus (A/H5)."
 - All birds raised in the affected facility has been dead or destroyed.
 - The facility has been disinfected.
 - Officials are to take necessary measures to prevent the outbreak 
 from spreading.

 A case of bird flu is suspected in the town of Kokonoe in Oita Prefecture 
 following the deaths of bantam roosters kept as pets, the Ministry of 
 Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said Tuesday.
 2 of 7 dead roosters tested positive for bird flu, and the National 
 Institute of Animal Health is conducting confirmation tests, ministry 
 officials said.  The ministry will find out the results in the evening, 
 they said.
 They said a household in the southwestern Japan town kept the 7 bantam 
 roosters along with 6 other roosters and 1 duck.
 The 6 other roosters and duck have been killed for testing to determine 
 whether all 14 had been infected. If infections are confirmed, this will 
 mark the 2nd outbreak of bird flu in Japan following the country's first in 
 79 years at a poultry farm in Yamaguchi Prefecture, detected 12 Jan 2004. 
 About 34 000 chickens were depopulated in the Yamaguchi case.
 According to ministry officials, a local animal health sanitary facility 
 reported the suspected case to the ministry Monday night via the Oita 
 prefectural government.  The household found 3 dead roosters Saturday and 4 
 others Sunday. It reported the findings to the Oita prefectural government 
 Sunday, they said.  The ministry has banned public access to the area and 
 sterilized chicken coops.
 About 570 000 chickens, or 1/3 of the total chickens raised in Oita 
 Prefecture, are kept within a 30-kilometer radius of the household in 
 question, a local livestock official said.
 The bird flu outbreak in Yamaguchi Prefecture has been traced to the same 
 strain as the H5N1 bird flu virus found in South Korea and Vietnam, which 
 have seen large-scale bird flu epidemics since late in 2003.
 Similar epidemics have also emerged in Thailand, Indonesia, and China. Some 
 people infected with the bird flu virus have died.
 Masato Tashiro, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Infectious 
 Diseases, said the suspected case in Oita Prefecture may have no link to 
 the Yamaguchi farm and could be contained easily.

 The 2nd bird flu case to hit Japan in 2004 has been reported in Oita 
 Prefecture, local government officials said Tuesday.
 A private breeder from Kokonoe, Oita Prefecture, reported to the town hall 
 that 7 of 13 Japanese bantams he raised at his home had died since last 
 weekend.
 Experts at a prefectural lab detected the bird flu virus in the dead 
 bantams, also known as Chabo. A duck raised by the same breeder also 
 developed an antibody against the bird flu virus, suggesting that it was 
 also infected with the disease.
 Samples from the birds have been sent to the National Institute of Animal 
 Health in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, for further examination.
 The type of bird flu virus that caused Japan's first outbreak in 80 years 
 in the Yamaguchi Prefecture town of Ato in January [2004] was one of the 
 deadliest and killed 80 percent of birds infected with it. Thousands of 
 chickens at a poultry farm in Ato where the outbreak was reported had to be 
 killed to stop the virus spreading.
 Agricultural Ministry officials said the bird flu outbreak was confirmed in 
 10 countries and regions, including Vietnam, Hong Kong, [mainland] China, the 
 United States, Germany and South Korea. [The strain in the US is not the same 
 strain as the Asian countries. � Mod.TG]
 People could get infected with the bird flu virus by coming into contact 
 with an infected bird, but it is safe to consume fully cooked chicken or eggs.
