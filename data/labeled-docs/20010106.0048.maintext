 Unverified Rumors of Viral Hemorrhagic Fever in Democratic Republic of Congo
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 The onset of the outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Gulu, Uganda has 
 heightened awareness of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the region. As a 
 result, WHO has been investigating periodic rumors of similar outbreaks in 
 the surrounding countries.
 In Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), WHO has investigated rumors in 
 Dungu, Bengadi, Isiro, Buta, Nyankunde and Bunia, and samples have been 
 negative for Ebola virus.
 As part of these ongoing operations, WHO is currently investigating 
 unverified reports of 2 additional cases for which few clinical details 
 have been reported, in Bunia, DRC.
 The WHO Outbreak Response Team in Gulu has been in contact with WHO Office, 
 Goma, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), Goma and the WHO sub-office in Bunia 
 regarding these unverified rumors. A WHO surveillance officer at the Bunia 
 sub-office is investigating the reports. In addition, a team from MSF and 
 WHO will travel to Bunia early next week. Previously 3 suspected cases were 
 reported in Bunia, one in early August, one in mid-November and a third in 
 late-November 2000. WHO investigations demonstrated that these rumors were 
 unfounded.
