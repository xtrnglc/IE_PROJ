 Dominican Republic: Detection of West Nile Virus Antibodies in Birds
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 SANTO DOMINGO: The Ministry of Health issued an epidemiologic alert 
 yesterday for febrile illnesses in humans after finding antibodies against 
 West Nile virus (WNV) in birds in the Los Haitises National Park.  West 
 Nile virus infection is transmitted to humans through bites from the 
 mosquito _Culex Quinquefasciatus_ which is abundant in the country.
 Health authorities cautioned the public not to be alarmed, but to take 
 precautionary measures, such as elimination of mosquito breeding sites, 
 cleaning household surroundings and seeking medical attention when 
 developing symptoms such as fever, headache, and muscular pains.  This 
 virus produces diseases that affect the central nervous system and is more 
 severe in persons of older age groups or those with illnesses that affect 
 their immune systems.  The country has also issued alerts to the Ministries 
 of Health of surrounding countries, as this is the first finding of WNV 
 outside of the continental territory of the United States [this should 
 state continental North America as the virus has been identified in Canada 
 in 2002, and in the past several days in Northern Mexico near the border 
 with the USA [see ProMED-mail posting: West Nile virus, birds - Mexico 
 (north)20030315.0640. - Mod.MPP] and therefore its [WNV] behavior in the 
 region is not yet known.
 The virus was identified for the first time in Uganda in 1937; in the 1950s 
 in Europe, and arrived in the United States in 1999 where during last year 
 [2002] there were 4000 cases reported in humans, of which there were 266 
 deaths associated with WNV infection. [There were 4161 cases and 277 deaths 
 reported to have occurred in the USA during 2002 as of data available on 
 the CDC WNV website current to 13 Mar 2003 
 <http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/wncount.htm> - Mod.MPP]
 The health authorities stated that a laboratory analysis conducted in the 
 United States last February [2003?], confirmed that some blood specimens 
 collected in November [2002?] from birds in the Los Haitises National Park 
 had specific antibodies against WNV.  This finding demonstrates that WNV 
 has been transmitted locally to birds resident in the  country.
 Among the steps that the country is taking through Provincial and Area 
 [county] level Health division is the establishment of epidemiologic 
 surveillance activities to detect human illnesses presenting as fever, 
 headache and muscular pains, and aseptic meningitis, especially in 
 geographic areas near to Los Haitises and other national parks.  This alert 
 has been initiated to implement a surveillance system that will detect an 
 outbreak in the early stages. A team from the University of Kansas of the 
 USA is due to arrive next week and will accompany the health authorities 
 from the Direction of Wild Life and Zoological Park, in the evaluation of a 
 model for epidemiologic surveillance [in humans and birds].
 The Dominican Republic receives approximately 18 species of migratory 
 birds. The director of CENCET presumes that WNV arrived [in the Dominican 
 Republic] with these migratory birds from other infected 
 countries.  Guillermo Gonzalvez explained that after establishing an 
 agreement of cooperation with the University of Kansas and the Centers for 
 Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the USA, between September and 
 November of last year [2002], a total of 152 specimens was collected from 
 37 different bird families. These specimens were sent to the CDC 
 laboratory, and nine of the specimens collected were positive for 
 flaviviruses, and five of these were confirmed to have antibodies against 
 WNV.  The virus itself was not isolated, but the detection of specific 
 antibodies against WNV indicates that WNV is circulating in the Criolle 
 [local] ecosystem.  Birds from which the WNV antibodies were identified are 
 known to inhabit populated areas such as Chuachua.

 Ornithologists of the University of Kansas in the United States, and at the 
 National Zoological Park, consider that one of the possible negative 
 impacts of the appearance of WNV in the Dominican Republic will be the 
 effect on bird population currently in need of conservation, since many may 
 become ill and die. They emphasized that the country has several species in 
 danger of extinction, of which those of most concern include 2 species of 
 crows, a duck, and the Ridgway sparrowhawk that almost exclusively lives in 
 the the Los Haitises National Park. However, at the present time, there 
 have been no birds, mammals or human beings identified with illness 
 associated with WNV infection.
