 Increased Incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in Switzerland
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 In the 13 Jul 2002 issue of the Lancet, Markus Glatzel, Colette Rogivue, 
 Azra Ghani, Johannes R Streffer, Lorenz Amsler and Adriano Aguzzi  report 
 an increase in the incidence of [sporadic] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) 
 in Switzerland. The abstract of their research letter reads as follows: " 
 The incidence of CJD in Switzerland increased two-fold in 2001, and figures 
 from the first quarter of 2002 indicate that it continues to rise. Neither 
 age at onset nor duration of disease were different from previous years. 
 Genetic analysis of the 27 reported cases revealed only one 
 disease-associated mutation in the prion gene. None of the recognized risk 
 factors for acquired CJD were reported on the official notification forms. 
 Glycotype profiling, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry indicate that 
 none of the cases fulfilled the definition of variant CJD, which is thought 
 to be caused by bovine prions. Several scenarios could account for the 
 increase in CJD, including improved reporting, iatrogenic transmission, and 
 transmission of a
 prion zoonosis."
 [Sporadic CJD is evenly distributed worldwide, with an incidence of about 
 one in a million per year. In Switzerland, however, the incidence rate has 
 risen over the past 2 years and appears to be increasing. The authors 
 consider that the relatively large number of individuals with CJD in 2001, 
 compared with previous years, is unlikely to be due to chance fluctuation 
 (Poisson probability 0�004, assuming constant incidence), and the quarterly 
 incidence data are better fit by an increasing exponential trend than by 
 assuming constant incidence (figure 1, p=0�02).
 The rise in incidence of CJD in Switzerland over the past 2 years could be 
 a result of ascertainment bias; i.e., increased awareness of the disease 
 might have led to enhanced detection of CJD in patients who would have 
 otherwise been misdiagnosed. Furthermore, in Switzerland the mere 
 suspicion, rather than the diagnosis, of CJD became statutorily notifiable 
 in March, 1999. However the authors do not consider that this is an 
 adequate explanation. An ascertainment bias hypothesis would postulate that 
 the true average incidence of sporadic CJD is 3 or more per million per 
 year, indicating that all countries other than Switzerland are 
 under-reporting by more than 50% the number of CJD patients diagnosed every 
 year.
 Genetic inheritance of CJD is unlikely to have contributed to the rise in 
 mortality from this disease, since familial instances of CJD co-segregate 
 with PRNP mutations, and the authors considered this explanation 
 incompatible with their data. One PRNP allele had a mutation associated 
 with hereditary dominant CJD; all other sequenced alleles had wild-type 
 sequences. The type 4 glycotype of the disease-associated prion protein 
 PrPSc  which is characteristic of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) 
 and vCJD was absent. Cortical florid PrP plaques  characteristic of vCJD 
 were not observed. Iatrogenic transmission could also be discounted because 
 none of the patients had been exposed to recognized risk factors.
 Finally the authors consider the possibility that CJD in Switzerland is 
 related to a prion epizootic, and pay considerable attention to this 
 possibility since between 1995 and 1998, Switzerland reported a larger 
 incidence of BSE than did all other continental European countries (415 
 cases between 1990 and 2002). Exposure to BSE-infected products might have 
 taken place mainly before high-risk bovine food products were banned from 
 the human food chain in 1990. However, BSE is thought to cause variant CJD 
 [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail] rather than sporadic 
 CJD, yet all evidence indicates that none of the Swiss cases fulfill the 
 diagnostic criteria of vCJD. Swiss CJD could be related to BSE only if the 
 strain of Swiss BSE prion differs from the strain of BSE prevalent in the 
 UK. Available data, though limited, suggest that this is not the case.
 At present there is no evidence that the Swiss CJD cases might result from 
 transmission of BSE to people after one or more serial passages through 
 species other than cattle. Scrapie is exceedingly rare in Switzerland: only 
 7 cases have been reported in the past 10 years. Chronic wasting disease of 
 deer has not been reported in Europe, although surveillance data on 
 transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in European game are incomplete.
 All recognized clinical and molecular markers combine to indicate that none 
 of the Swiss patients developed vCJD. The authors conclude that the 
 elucidation of the underlying chain of events is a national research 
 priority, and may uncover previously unrecognized modes of prion infection 
 and transmission. It remains to be seen whether this increase in the 
 incidence of CJD in Switzerland will be sustained, or whether it represent 
 a statistical anomaly. According to Will RG, et al. (Ann Neurol 1998; 43: 
 763-767) there was a doubling in the annual death rates for sporadic CJD in 
 the United Kingdom between the 1980s and the 1990s, and similar increases 
 in the apparent death rates for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease had 
 occurred in other European countries, attributable to  improvement in 
 diagnosis. - Mod.CP]
