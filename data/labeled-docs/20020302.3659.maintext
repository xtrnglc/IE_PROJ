 These curious rashes among American school children without any signs 
 of systemic illness remind me of a similar outbreak with hundreds of 
 people in Western Berlin, Germany, during the early sixties. At this 
 time I was working as a young doctor in the Department of Infectious 
 Diseases in the Rudolf Virchow Hospital.
 At first we had no idea concerning the etiology. Since our department 
 was in charge of the management of the sick, we started to consider 
 the hypothesis of an unknown virus. To our own surprise, a 
 distinguished virological institute claimed to have isolated such a 
 virus (the details I cannot remember) from the material of some 
 patients.
 It took about a week until we and our colleagues from the Department 
 of Health found out that the disease was caused by a nutritive 
 allergen. A big food company had just added a new emulsifier to a 
 brand of margarine that was only sold in the western part of Berlin 
 (at that time still separate). After that lot had been taken from the 
 market, the problem resolved immediately.
 [Thank you Dr. Volkmer for this very interesting and 
 thought-provoking account of a similar type rash illness outbreak. 
 It would be of interest to know if a possible food allergen might be 
 the culprit in some or all of these current outbreak occurrences -- 
 perhaps a common food preparation product distributed to schools for 
 use in school lunch programs.  Reviewing the details of the 
 individual state outbreaks, some of the outbreaks seem to have more 
 of a contact dermatitis picture, suggesting an environmental 
 irritant, but the possibility of a common "food irritant" as 
 described by Dr. Volkmer remains very intriguing.  We await further 
 information on these outbreaks. - Mods.MPP/JW]
