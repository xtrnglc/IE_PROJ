 Zimbabwe foot-and-mouth outbreak spreads south
 -----------------------------------------------
 .
 An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Zimbabwe has spread south 
 from Bulawayo to the Beitbridge district bordering South Africa, an 
 industry official said. "We have investigated and confirmed there has been 
 FMD infection in the Jepempe resettlement area of Beitbridge," Stuart 
 Hargreaves, director of the government's Department of Veterinary Services 
 said.
 The report said quarantine officers had moved to the vast Gonarezhou 
 national wildlife park in southeastern Zimbabwe, suspected to have to been 
 the source of the outbreak of the disease last week.
 The Zimbabwe Cattle Producers' Association (ZCPA) says the country would 
 combat the outbreak -- first detected at a feedlot near Bulawayo in the 
 mainly ranching province of Matabeleland -- with vaccines and tight 
 controls on livestock movement, avoiding a mass cull of cattle.
 The disease forced the country to suspend beef exports. The state-owned 
 Cold Storage Company, Zimbabwe's sole beef exporting body, has an annual 
 export quota of 9 100 tons worth 2 billion Zimbabwe dollars ($36 million) 
 to the European Union and 5,000 tons to South Africa.
 The veterinary department says it has the capacity and resources to contain 
 the outbreak. Hargreaves said the United Nations Food and Agricultural 
 Organization had also pledged emergency assistance.
 Industry officials say Zimbabwe's communal farmers' cattle herd numbers 
 about 4.5 million animals while the commercial herd is estimated at 1.2 
 million.
