 But for a more serious look, no pun intended, at crocodilian 
 pathophysiology, including contenders for this condition, readers may be 
 interested in the following 2002 review paper by Huchzermeyer 
 <http://www.oie.int/eng/publicat/rt/2102/HUCHZERMEYER.pdf>.
 [Briefly, this article thoroughly covers a number of crocodilian diseases, 
 some rare, some common, but a good review of the diseases and how they 
 affect the animal. - Mod.TG]
 Living in Mobile, Alabama and having personally seen several of the 
 reptiles in question, up close, I can state that they have not been shot!
