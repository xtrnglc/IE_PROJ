 We hear from a reliable source that there is an outbreak in the Democratic 
 Republic of the Congo with hundreds of cases and a few deaths of what is 
 suspected to be plague. Plague is endemic there.  ProMED-mail would 
 appreciate confirmation.
 Note that the Congo lies across the border to the west of Uganda, an area 
 where there is currently a plague outbreak (see ref. above).
