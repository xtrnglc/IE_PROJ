 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 The composition of the influenza vaccine for the 2004/05 season (Northern 
 Hemisphere winter) was announced by the World Health Organization in Geneva 
 on Fri 13 Feb 2004. The vaccine will contain:
 (1) an A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like virus;
 (2) an A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2)-like virus*;
 (3) a B/Shanghai/361/2002-like virus�.
 * The currently used vaccine virus is A/Wyoming/3/2003. A 
 /Kumamoto/102/2002 is also available as a vaccine virus.
 � Candidate vaccine viruses include B/Shanghai/361/2002 and 
 B/Jilin/20/2003, which is a B/Shanghai/361/2002-like virus
 [This decision presupposes that the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus 
 currently circulating in East Asia will remain confined to avian hosts and 
 will not acquire by mutation or sub-unit reassortment properties 
 facilitating human-to-human transmission, thereby becoming a novel pandemic 
 virus. - Mod.CP]
 [The composition is decided by consensus among an international group of 
 influenza experts.  The decision has to be taken in February in order to give 
 the manufacturers sufficient time to gear up and produce the vaccine. -
