 Typhus outbreak in North Kazakhstan
 -------------------------------------------------------
 .
 There is an outbreak of louse-borne classical typhus in North Kazakhstan 
 Region. It is mostly children who are are sick. A total of 18 cases of 
 typhus have been registered during the last 2 months. Classical typhus was 
 associated with the Civil War [of 1918-1920 in the former Soviet Union] and 
 the devastation of the first years of Soviet power. Yelena Koptyayeva, head 
 of the children's infectious disease department of the third hospital of 
 Petropavlovsk, said "We had only one louse- borne classical typhus case in 
 1997 and 7 cases in 1998-1999. At present, if we take into account the 
 activity of our lice from April to October, then this year we have 
 registered 44 [sick] people so far, but this [includes] louse-borne 
 classical [typhus] and louse bites with a localised reaction.
 The 18 children with the diagnosis of louse-borne classical typhus, 
 admitted to the infectious department of the third city hospital during the 
 past 2 months, originate mainly from the Kyzylzhar District [surrounding 
 Petropavlovsk]. Not only has the number of sick people increased sharply, 
 but the illness itself is much more serious than before. Dr Koptyayeva 
 said: "[In earlier cases] health improved, in general, within 10 days, now 
 it is a completely different picture. The [fever] lasts longer. The high 
 temperature is remittent and some children have a high temperature for up 
 to 20 days."
 The [outbreak] has already been raging for 2 months, but the talk of 
 dealing with it, even of setting up recreation zones around the town [of 
 Petropavlovsk] arose only at the beginning of June [2000].
 [Classical (epidemic) louse-borne typhus is caused by the intracellular 
 bacterium _Rickettsia prowazekii_. The vector is the body (clothes) louse 
 _Pediculus vestimenti_; typhus infection is not transmitted by either the 
 head louse or the crab louse. Patients become infected by inhalation of 
 louse faeces or by faecal contamination of bites. Classical typhus is 
 endemic or quasi-endemic in 54 coutries. Historically, outbreaks of 
 epidemic typhus are associated with war, famine and social deprivation. 
 Although typhus was wide-spread throughout the Soviet Union and Europe in 
 the aftermath of the Second World War, it was rapidly contained and largely 
 eliminated from the Soviet Union by the mid-fifties.
 Disinfestation is the principal method of control. However, a non-sterile 
 immunity can develop after infection and recrudescent typhus (Brill-Zinsser 
 disease) can occur from months to years following initial infection. 
 Outbreaks of typhus can occur if the index patient is louse-infested and in 
 contact with others lacking immunity. The organism does not persist in the 
 louse.
 Rickettsial infection involves all organ systems and as a consequence the 
 clinical manifestations are non-specific. However, pneumonia and CNS 
 involvement are rare. Rapid diagnosis depends on awareness of prevalence of 
 the vector. Antibiotic treatment (tetracycline in adults and 
 chloramphenicol in children) is effective, if begun early; once fulminant 
 disease develops, antibiotic treatment is less effective. Several vaccines 
 have been developed, but none is currently in use because of fear of 
 reversion to virulence and the availability of other methods of control.
 Typically, in the Soviet era schools were often the focal points of typhus 
 outbreaks. The present report suggest a similar pattern, possibly as a 
 consequence of the social and economic turmoil following the dissolution of 
 the Soviet Union. The apparent increased severity of the disease could 
 reflect declining immunity, antibiotic resistance or strain variability. A 
 breakdown in vector control could be another factor. Increased resistance 
 of the vector to insecticides is less likely. This report of epidemic 
 typhus in Kazakhstan is significant in view of the current expansion of 
 oil-related industry and increased opportunity for foreign travel. - Mod.CP]

 Lice, and History" which was written by Hans Zinsser in the 1930's as a 
 "biography" of typhus fever. - Man. Ed. DS]
