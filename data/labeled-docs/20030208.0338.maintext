 United Kingdom: increasing influenza B virus activity
 -----------------------------------------------------
 .
 The Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) has received the first 
 reports for the 2002-3 season, of outbreaks of influenza-like illness, all 
 of which have occurred in schools. Positive detections of influenza B virus 
 have been reported from three cases, in the south of England, during weeks 
 4 and 5 (week ending Sun 2 Feb 2003). Attack rates have ranged from 15 per 
 cent to 58 per cent. Additional reports of outbreaks have since been 
 received from the north of England where influenza activity has been 
 detected in several schools through the monitoring of school sickness 
 absence rates.
 Overall this season in the United Kingdom (UK), both laboratory detections 
 and clinical indicators for influenza have been low, with influenza B virus 
 comprising the majority of laboratory reports. Indicators in England, 
 however, in the last few weeks from both the Royal College of General 
 Practitioners (RCGP) weekly returns sentinel service for consultation rates 
 for influenza-like illness and calls to the NHS Direct [telephone advisory 
 service] for "cold/flu", have shown an increase in the 5 to 14 year age 
 group for week 4, suggesting rising influenza B virus activity in children. 
 Influenza B virus traditionally causes milder symptoms than influenza A 
 virus and commonly affects the younger age groups.
 This season, in Europe and the United States, influenza B virus has also 
 been the major influenza virus in circulation. Confirmation of the 
 virological cause of outbreaks of influenza-like illness, and other 
 outbreaks of acute respiratory illness, may be of value in the management 
 of the local outbreak, while contributing to the surveillance of influenza 
 virus strains that may be relevant for future vaccine composition.
 [Influenza B virus infection appears to be widespread now throughout Europe 
 and the Americas (see references below), and perhaps also in the Far East. 
 On Sun 2 Feb 2003 ProMED-mail received a report originating from Yomiuri 
 Shimbun <http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/20030202wo34.htm>, relayd by Waldyr 
 Milagres Junior <milagres@fclnet.com.br>, reporting an extensive influenza 
 epidemic affecting 3667 schools in Japan, with a three-fold increase over 
 the number of cases recorded in the previous week. According to a 
 nationwide survey of nurseries, kindergartens, primary and middle schools, 
 about 129 000 children had suffered from influenza as of 25 Jan 2003, up 
 about 89 000 from the previous week's survey and about 10 times as many 
 cases compared with the corresponding period last year. The etiologic agent 
 was not identified, but it seems likely that influenza B virus is 
 responsible. - Mod.CP]
