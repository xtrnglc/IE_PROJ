 Deadly black mold causes evacuation of Texas families
 ------------------------------------
 .
 A potentially fatal black mold has forced at least 19 families in usually 
 dry West Texas to evacuate their homes and move into hotel rooms. The 
 mold's potential health effects range from cold- and allergic-type symptoms 
 to skin rashes, inflammation of the respiratory tract, bloody noses, fever, 
 headaches, malaise, neurological problems, and suppression of the immune 
 system.
 A particularly rainy year has caused stachybotrys outbreaks in some of the 
 southern United States. Stachybotrys mold is not rare, according to the 
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, but CDC has no 
 accurate information on how often it is found in homes and other buildings. 
 Molds of any type, including stachybotrys, simply need moisture and 
 something such as wood or paper to grow on, said Dr David Straus, a 
 microbiologist at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and an 
 expert on indoor air pollution caused by molds. Stachybotrys cases are not 
 increasing, he said, but local media reports have heightened awareness of 
 the problem. Above normal rainfall in many parts of West Texas in recent 
 months, on top of heavy snowfall last winter, could have raised the 
 region's water table, Straus said.
 To rid a home of the mold, the source of the moisture first must be 
 eliminated. Then the mold must be removed using a bleach-like solution, and 
 all the damaged materials -- sometimes including walls, ceilings, and 
 carpets -- must be torn out and replaced.

 [Stachybotrys is a very serious health threat. Most often this mold is 
 associated with wet areas, such as homes after flooding. It has been found 
 on hay, which if fed to animals has caused death of the animals. - Mod.TG]
