 Serious unexplained illness among injecting drug users in Scotland and the 
 Republic of Ireland �update
 A total of 35 injecting drug users in Scotland had developed a serious 
 unexplained illness as described in previous reports by 5 June (1,2). 6 of 
 the cases have been identified since the last update (2), 4 probable (all 
 from Greater Glasgow Health Board) and 2 definite. One of the definite 
 cases, from Lanarkshire Health Board, presented on 1 June; the other, from 
 Greater Glasgow, presented on 4 June but developed symptoms on 28 May.
 Seventeen of the 35 cases are definite cases, 14 of whom are from Greater 
 Glasgow, 2 from Grampian, and one from Lanarkshire. The remaining 18 are 
 probable cases, all from Greater Glasgow. 15 definite cases and 2 probable 
 cases have died. 15 of the deaths have occurred in Greater Glasgow cases, 
 and both Grampian cases have died.
 Intensive investigations are continuing, including a case control study 
 that began on 3 June. In Dublin, a further fatal case has been identified 
 since the report last week (3), bringing the total to 15 cases, 8 of whom 
 have died. Thus, a total of 50 probable and definite cases have arisen in 
 Scotland and Ireland, 25 of whom have died.
 Similar illnesses among injecting drug users in England and Wales forms the 
 subject of a separate report in this issue (4). Further investigations are 
 under way to determine possible links between these incidents.

 Serious unexplained illness among drug injectors in England
 Epidemiological and microbiological investigations of the serious 
 unexplained illness among injecting drug users (IDUs) described last week 
 (1,2) have now identified 64 cases (32 fatal) who have been admitted to 
 hospital or have died with an unexplained illness in the United Kingdom and 
 Ireland since 19 April 2000. Blood and tissue cultures from several 
 patients have yielded multiple organisms including group A streptococcus, 
 Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium species, and Bacillus species, but a 
 definitive cause has not been identified. There is no evidence of Bacillus 
 anthracis infection. The PHLS Central Public Health Laboratory and the PHLS 
 Anaerobe Reference Unit at Cardiff are assisting with the examination of 
 specimens.
 For the purpose of focusing surveillance and microbiological investigations 
 the following case definition has been developed in collaboration with 
 investigators in Scotland, Ireland, and the United States (see forthcoming 
 MMWR):
 An IDU admitted to hospital or found dead since 1 April 2000 with soft 
 tissue inflammation (abscess, cellulitis, fasciitis, or myositis) at an 
 injection site AND either severe systemic toxicity (total peripheral white 
 blood cell count > 30 x 10^9/L and sustained systolic pressure < 90 mmHg 
 despite fluid resuscitation) or evidence at necropsy of a diffuse toxic or 
 infectious process including pleural effusion and soft tissue oedema or 
 necrosis at an injection site.
 The cases under investigation that have died, and meet this case 
 definition, have not had other clearly identified infections that could 
 explain the cause of death nor evidence of drug overdose. Since 19 April, 
 35 IDUs have been admitted to hospital or have died in Scotland with a 
 serious unexplained illness; the cases include 17 deaths (3). In Dublin, 15 
 IDUs have been admitted to hospital since 14 April, eight of whom have died 
 (3).
 In England and Wales from 24 April to 2 June 14 IDUs were admitted to 
 hospital with a severe systemic or inflammatory reaction requiring 
 intensive care or high dependency treatment, including 7 who died. 
 According to current information, 6 of these cases (5 of whom have died) 
 met the specific case definition above. The median age of these 6 cases was 
 34 years (range 30 to 48), 4 were men, and all lived in the North West 
 Region. The median highest white cell count recorded was 51.9 x 10^9/L 
 (range 39.7-82.0). All 6 had progressive symptoms for a median of 3 days 
 (range 1 to 4) between the onset of illness and hospital admission. Among 
 the cases who died in hospital, a median of 3 days elapsed between 
 admission and death (range 0 to 3). Pleural effusion was a prominent 
 feature at necropsy.
 Early surgical intervention should be considered in the management of 
 possible cases, including exploration, drainage, and/or debridement of any 
 injection site infection together with microbiological sampling. In 
 addition to surgical and supportive therapy, specific antimicrobial therapy 
 should include one or more agents known to be active against anaerobes 
 (such as penicillin, metronidazole, and clindamycin, possibly in 
 combination). Clindamycin may have some specific advantages in these cases, 
 but it should not be given alone as resistance to this antibiotic has been 
 described.
 A detailed protocol for specimen collection and examination for the 
 investigation of suspected cases has been devised. In England and Wales 
 this is available from the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre 
 (CDSC; tel 020 8200 6868). Particular care should be exercised to maximise 
 opportunities for the recovery of fastidious anaerobes.

 Five More Drug Addicts Die From Mystery Illness
  From the Press Association
 8 Jun 2000
 The mystery illness which claimed the lives drug addicts in Glasgow has 
 killed 5 people in north west England, health officials have confirmed. 2 
 heroin users in Liverpool and 3 from Manchester have died over the last 
 month from the unidentified illness, bringing the total death toll to 35 in 
 Britain and Ireland.
 The NHS Executive North West says it has identified 9 cases in the 2 cities 
 over the past month, of which 5 had died. It confirmed the new cases were 
 being linked to the fatalities in Scotland, a further 8 in Dublin, and 7 in 
 other parts of England. An NHS spokeswoman said: "An investigation over the 
 last month suggests that there have been 9 cases in Manchester and 
 Liverpool similar to those in Scotland, of which 5 have died. Although 
 various organisms have been found in tissue samples, no definitive cause of 
 death has been identified."
 Professor John Ashton, regional director of public health, said: "We are 
 very concerned that the infection has appeared in the North West. As yet, 
 we have found no pattern either in where the patients come from or in their 
 supply of heroin.

 The Big Issue [a magazine] in Scotland is demanding a public inquiry after 
 the death of one of its vendors from the mystery illness which has killed 
 32 drug injectors in the UK and Ireland. The magazine said the [named] 
 heroin addict followed the advice of Greater Glasgow Health Board when 
 abscesses appeared on his legs.
 He went to an accident and emergency department at the Victoria Infirmary. 
 Staff allegedly sent him back to the hostel where he was living after a 
 10-minute consultation. The 35-year-old is said to have been refused a home 
 visit by a GP and within 48 hours he was taken to Paisley's Royal Alexandra 
 Hospital, where he died on 5 June.

 14 cases, 7 dead - England and Wales
 15 cases, 8 dead - Ireland
 Figures from Greater Glasgow Health Board
 Tricia Hughes, co-director of The Big Issue in Scotland, said: "We need a 
 public inquiry to find out why the heroin addict died after he was sent 
 home by staff at the Victoria Infirmary after just a 10-minute examination. 
 Homeless people receive a second-rate health service and are dying as a 
 result. Despite the publicity surrounding the mystery illness that is 
 killing heroin users in Glasgow, nobody has highlighted the number of these 
 people who were homeless at the time of their deaths."

 for the health of addicts. -Mod. MHJ]
