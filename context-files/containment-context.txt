CONTEXT: Anthrax vaccine offered to civilians [edited] --------------------------------------------- .

CONTEXT: Sent: Thu 20 Dec 2001 7:52 AM From: JoeParrish <JoeParrish@compuserve.com> Source: ENVIRONMENT NEWS SERVICE (ENS) [edited] <http://ens-news.com/ens/dec2001/2001L-12-19-06.html> WASHINGTON DC, 19 Dec 2001 (ENS): Members of congress and others who may  have been exposed to anthrax from contaminated letters will be offered a  controversial anthrax vaccine, the United States Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) said on Tuesday.

CONTEXT: The vaccine, formerly available only  to military personnel, will be administered as part of an experimental study.

CONTEXT: HHS is providing 2 additional options beyond  the 60 day course for those who may wish to pursue them: an extended course  of antibiotics, and experimental treatment with the anthrax vaccine.

CONTEXT: The  vaccine, developed for use by military personnel who could be exposed to  weapons-grade anthrax in the field, is only intended to protect people who  are immunized before exposure.

CONTEXT: HHS is offering the vaccine to about 3000 people -- members of congress,  their staff, postal workers, and journalists who could have encountered  spores from the contaminated letters -- "out of an abundance of caution,"  said HHS secretary Tommy Thompson.

CONTEXT: "Anthrax is a rare disease, and so that  the vaccine used in this way would represent a different way of using  vaccine than it's been used before," explained Dr D A Henderson of the HHS  Office of Public Health Preparedness.

CONTEXT: Here we are providing vaccine after, 60 days after,  to give them antibodies, so that they might be protected against a risk."

CONTEXT: Tommy Thompson said, "As an investigational new drug, the vaccine would  have to be given with the full informed consent of the individual as to  possible risks.

CONTEXT: Those receiving the vaccine would also be asked to take  part in a follow-up study to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine  when it is given after exposure."

CONTEXT: The decision to use the vaccine will be  at the discretion of the individual, in consultation with his or her  physician, Thompson said.

CONTEXT: HHS says that the vaccine [normally given in a series of 6 injections over  18 months] will be given to interested volunteers in 3 doses, spread out  over 4 weeks.

CONTEXT: Anyone accepting the vaccine will also be required to take  antibiotics for another 40 days.

CONTEXT: The agency explained that for the  military, the vaccine is given in a manner intended to provide long term  protection over many years.

CONTEXT: Kathy Zoon from the Food and Drug Administration told reporters  on Tuesday that those who accept the vaccine can expect some mild side  effects, include "redness and swelling at the site of injection," lasting  from days to weeks.

CONTEXT: The HHS has paid the Department of Defense $598 000 for about 219 000 doses  of the anthrax vaccine, but expects to use fewer than 3000.

CONTEXT: As many as 3000 people are at the  highest risk of having lingering spores and might be candidates for an  anthrax vaccine, officials said."

CONTEXT: I recently came across a study done in 1986 that compared the Sterne and  acellular vaccines using guinea pigs (1).

CONTEXT: The researchers found that the  acellular vaccine, which is very similar if not identical to the one in use  today, gave poor protection against most strains of anthrax except the  Vollum and Vollum 1B strains, against which protection was 100 per cent.

CONTEXT: Comparative efficacy of Bacillus anthracis live spore  vaccine and protective antigen vaccine against anthrax in the guinea pig.

CONTEXT: Some references for the efficacy of the  acellular anthrax vaccine adsorbed are the following: Ivins BE, Fellows PF, Pitt MLM, Estep JE, Welkos SL, Worsham PL, et al.

CONTEXT: Efficacy of a standard human anthrax vaccine against Bacillus anthracis  aerosol spore challenge in rhesus monkeys.

CONTEXT: Comparative efficacy of experimental anthrax vaccine candidates against  inhalation anthrax in rhesus macaques.

CONTEXT: Anthrax vaccine: Evidence for safety  and efficacy against inhalational anthrax.

CONTEXT: Efficacy of a human anthrax vaccine in guinea pigs, rabbits, and rhesus  macaques against challenge by Bacillus anthracis isolates of diverse  geographical origin.

CONTEXT: In the article, he is quoted as  saying that this is not an experimental vaccine trial being given since it  is being administered for preventive purposes only.

CONTEXT: There probably is  another vaccine now in existence according to earlier Post articles but it  is yet to be sufficiently safe.

CONTEXT: [There are several new human, advanced vaccines being developed in the US  and in Europe, with the British vaccine possibly in the lead and due for  release in 2003.

CONTEXT: But as Michelle Mocke said at the 4th International  Anthrax Conference in Annapolis, the Sterne vaccine is still the gold  standard.

CONTEXT: No vaccine provides significant protection for more than 12  months.

CONTEXT: A new vaccine has been announced  in Israel.

CONTEXT: - Mod.MHJ] Laboratories of the Biological Institute in Nes-Ziona,Israel, have  completed the development of an injectable vaccine against anthrax.

CONTEXT: The  vaccine has successfully passed the experimental stages and been found  efficient.

CONTEXT: The vaccine is not yet commercially produced, but experts  [suggest that], if a decision is made, quantities sufficient for the entire  Israeli population could be produced in months.

CONTEXT: According to various recent publications, including one a few months ago in  the Journal of the American Microbiological Society, the vaccine was  developed by genetic engineering and in cooperation with the army and the  Ministry of Health.

CONTEXT: During its testing phases the vaccine was administered  to volunteer soldiers not exposed to the disease agent itself.

CONTEXT: As published in the American journal, the efficacy of the  vaccine was demonstrated in challenged guinea pigs, while the immunization  lasted for a year.

CONTEXT: It has been said that while the American vaccine confers immunity only  after 6 doses, the Israeli one protects after one dose.

CONTEXT: The American  vaccine is said to cause also some unwanted reactions, including headaches,  shivering, and fever, as well as serious allergic reactions.

CONTEXT: Scientific  sources in Israel [suggest that] such phenomena are not caused by the  Israeli vaccine.

CONTEXT: Until the Israeli vaccine has been given to a few  thousand people, the true range and severity of its side effects remain  unknown.

CONTEXT: The severe side effects attributed here to the US vaccine are  overstated and restricted to only a handful of people in the thousands  vaccinated.

CONTEXT: Similarly, information on the reliability of the Israeli  vaccine in humans will emerge only from controlled studies.

CONTEXT: But they are to  be congratulated in getting their vaccine to this stage of readiness.
