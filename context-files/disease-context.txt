CONTEXT: The cholera epidemic had started in the separatist island of Anjouan before spreading to Grand Comoro, within which lies the Comorian capital.

CONTEXT: There were no fresh figures on the cholera situation in Anjouan island, where on average 300 new cases were recorded per week before the island was blockaded 20 March to prevent the disease from spreading to other islands.

CONTEXT: <pollackmp@mindspring.com> Source: Xinhua News Agency [edited] At least 93 people have died from cholera and other forms of acute diarrhea since February in the Mozambican capital Maputo, said the city's health director Olivia Ferreira on Friday.

CONTEXT: Over the period, a total of 5749 cases of cholera and acute diarrhea had been notified in the capital city, she said.

CONTEXT: It seems that in most cases the causative organism was not the cholera vibrio, she said, citing that out of a sample of 300 people suffering from diarrhea, it was found that only 15 percent of them had the cholera vibrio.

CONTEXT: Ferreira urged Maputo residents to go to health unit as soon as they start suffering from diarrhea or fevers, since these could be the symptoms of cholera or malaria.

CONTEXT: Preslar  <dpreslar@fas.org> Source: <http://usinfo.state.gov/products/washfile/latest.shtml> SATELLITES USED TO HELP PREDICT DEADLY DISEASE OUTBREAKS  NASA is providing new insights from space that may help health officials predict outbreaks of deadly water-borne cholera, a bacterial infection of the small intestine that can be fatal to humans.

CONTEXT: Scientists have learned how to use satellites to track blooms of tiny floating plant and animal plankton that carry cholera bacteria by using satellite data on ocean temperatures, sea height and other climate variables.

CONTEXT: "These experiments fulfill our hypothesis that cholera is associated with environmental conditions," said Dr.

CONTEXT: She is presently on leave of absence from the University of Maryland, and is co-author of the cholera-tracking project paper.

CONTEXT: The authors found that rising sea temperatures and ocean height near the coast of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal from 1992 to 1995 often preceded sudden growth, or "blooms," of plankton and outbreaks of cholera.

CONTEXT: "When such a model for Bangladesh is extended to the global scale, it may serve as an early warning system, enabling effective deployment of resources to minimize or prevent cholera epidemics in cholera-endemic regions," according to Brad Lobitz, principal author of the paper and a contract scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center, located in California's Silicon Valley.

CONTEXT: The scientists correlated years of hospital cholera records from Bangladesh with sea temperature and ocean height data that came from a variety of satellites and surface observations.

CONTEXT: The seventh cholera pandemic began in 1961 and now affects six continents, according to the paper.

CONTEXT: Sea height is important because tides reach further inland to affect more people who may drink or bathe in brackish water carrying cholera.

CONTEXT: "In most years Bangladesh has two cholera outbreaks," Lobitz said.

CONTEXT: The authors discovered that the sea surface temperatures show an annual cycle similar to the cholera-case data.

CONTEXT: More information about the cholera-tracking project is on the Internet at:http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/health/projects/cholera/cholera.htmlThe researchers used data from three Earth-observing satellites in the study: a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration weather satellite, the SeaWiFS instrument aboard the SeaStar (OrbView-2) satellite, and the U.S.- French TOPEX/Poseidon oceanography satellite.

ANSWER: leaf rust
CONTEXT: Wheat leaf rust has appeared earlier than usual again in the northern plains this year.

CONTEXT: **********  Wheat leaf rust.

CONTEXT: During April and early May, leaf rust development was slowed throughout the central Great Plains because of moisture shortage, but with the return of moisture in the form of rain and dew in mid-May the leaf rust increase process was rejuvenated.

CONTEXT: During late May, traces of leaf rust were found in southeastern Nebraska winter wheat plots and fields.

CONTEXT: On May 30, traces of leaf rust were observed on the leaves of winter wheat cultivars in east central North Dakota plots.

ANSWER: _Rickettsia prowazekii_
CONTEXT: [Classical (epidemic) louse-borne typhus is caused by the intracellular  bacterium _Rickettsia prowazekii_.

ANSWER: typhus
CONTEXT: There is an outbreak of louse-borne classical typhus in North Kazakhstan  Region.

CONTEXT: A total of 18 cases of  typhus have been registered during the last 2 months.

CONTEXT: Classical typhus was  associated with the Civil War [of 1918-1920 in the former Soviet Union] and  the devastation of the first years of Soviet power.

CONTEXT: Yelena Koptyayeva, head  of the children's infectious disease department of the third hospital of  Petropavlovsk, said "We had only one louse- borne classical typhus case in  1997 and 7 cases in 1998-1999.

CONTEXT: At present, if we take into account the  activity of our lice from April to October, then this year we have  registered 44 [sick] people so far, but this [includes] louse-borne  classical [typhus] and louse bites with a localised reaction.

CONTEXT: The 18 children with the diagnosis of louse-borne classical typhus,  admitted to the infectious department of the third city hospital during the  past 2 months, originate mainly from the Kyzylzhar District [surrounding  Petropavlovsk].

CONTEXT: [Classical (epidemic) louse-borne typhus is caused by the intracellular  bacterium _Rickettsia prowazekii_.

CONTEXT: The vector is the body (clothes) louse  _Pediculus vestimenti_; typhus infection is not transmitted by either the  head louse or the crab louse.

CONTEXT: Classical typhus is  endemic or quasi-endemic in 54 coutries.

CONTEXT: Historically, outbreaks of  epidemic typhus are associated with war, famine and social deprivation.

CONTEXT: Although typhus was wide-spread throughout the Soviet Union and Europe in  the aftermath of the Second World War, it was rapidly contained and largely  eliminated from the Soviet Union by the mid-fifties.

CONTEXT: However, a non-sterile  immunity can develop after infection and recrudescent typhus (Brill-Zinsser  disease) can occur from months to years following initial infection.

CONTEXT: Outbreaks of typhus can occur if the index patient is louse-infested and in  contact with others lacking immunity.

CONTEXT: Typically, in the Soviet era schools were often the focal points of typhus  outbreaks.

CONTEXT: This report of epidemic  typhus in Kazakhstan is significant in view of the current expansion of  oil-related industry and increased opportunity for foreign travel.

CONTEXT: WHO Confirms First Outbreak Of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever In Uganda ---------------------------------------------------------------- .

ANSWER: haemorrhagic fever
CONTEXT: The World Health Organization (WHO), in conjunction with its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, is coordinating the international response to an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in Gulu District, northern Uganda.

CONTEXT: [Ebola haemorrhagic fever is one of the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind, causing death in 50-90% of cases.

CONTEXT: At least 63 people in northern Uganda in the past 2 weeks have contracted a viral haemorrhagic fever that has now been identified by health authorities as Ebola hemorrhagic fever.

ANSWER: Ebola virus
CONTEXT: [The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is a technical partnership of national and international institutions and smaller networks who mobilize and pool their resources so that outbreaks of potential international importance are detected, verified and responded to efficiently and effectively by the international community.] Laboratory testing carried out at the National Institute of Virology in South Africa indicates that the cause of the outbreak is Ebola virus.

CONTEXT: The Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or semen of infected persons.

CONTEXT: The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 in the western equatorial province of Sudan and in the nearby region of Yambuku, northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire.] The Ugandan Ministry of Health has established a National Task Force for he Control of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers, for managing the response to the epidemic.

CONTEXT: The National Institute of Virology in Johannesburg, South Africa, has confirmed by PCR test that Ebola virus is present in the current outbreak in Uganda.

CONTEXT: NAIROBI: Uganda's neighbors have moved swiftly to try to stem the spread of the deadly Ebola virus which has killed at least 33 people in the east African country in the past two weeks.

CONTEXT: [The positive identification of the etiological agent as Ebola virus makes a link with Zaire less likely, particularly in view of the serological data referred to by Professor Werner Slenczka in the previous post, which revealed a low frequency of antibody reacting with Ebola virus and an absence of antibody reacting with Marburg virus among the inhabitants of northern Uganda.

ANSWER: The Ebola virus
CONTEXT: The Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or semen of infected persons.

CONTEXT: *****  Date: 26 Feb 2001 Source: National Pig Association  Limited exemption to the suspension of Great Britain livestock movement (1.16pm, 25 Feb 2001)  The Ministry of Agriculture today (Sunday, 25 Feb 2001) announced limited exemptions to the 7-day total prohibition of livestock movements imposed to ensure the containment and eradication of FMD.

CONTEXT: ***** Date: 26 Feb 2001 Source: BBC  Outbreaks 8 and 9 were confirmed at an abattoir in Wiltshire (which had had taken the lamb from the Devon outbreak 7) and a second farm in Devon (under same ownership as case 7) Sheep with FMD signs were found at an abattoir at Gaerwen on the island of Anglesey, Wales.

CONTEXT: ***** Date: 26 Feb 2001 Source: National Pig Association  [edited] 25 000 animals exposed to foot and mouth at 3 marts (6.15pm, 26 Feb 2001)  After sheep dealer Willy Cleave of Burdon Farm, Highampton, Devon, got FMD on his farms in the West Country - probably as a result of a link with the Waugh brothers swill-feeding farm at East Heddon in Northumberland - and before the disease became apparent, he had dealings with Hexham, Longtown (Carlisle) and Northampton marts.

CONTEXT: This means 25 000 animals may have been exposed to FMD as they passed through the 3 markets.

CONTEXT: Veterinarians will check some 3000 British pigs on 20 farms in Lower Saxony for FMD.

CONTEXT: Carcass tests in Germany have not found FMD, so far.

CONTEXT: (5.30pm, Feb 26) Total number of outbreaks of FMD has risen to 12.

CONTEXT: The ban applies to cattle, pigs, sheep and goats, but not to horses, poultry, milk, cereal, vegetables or animal feed."]  I believe milk tankers were implicated in past outbreaks as a means of  spread of  FMD virus between farms.

CONTEXT: Air is displaced during the milk loading process and creates aerosols capable of being a source of spread of FMD virus through the dispersal of infected milk particles picked up from a previous infected dairy or dairies where the disease was incubating.

CONTEXT: [The FMD outbreak appears to be enlarging; sheep are now involved.

ANSWER: Sin Nombre virus
CONTEXT: As for the etiologic agent being Sin Nombre virus, I don't think so.

CONTEXT: That  virus has never been shown to occur in India (or even outside North  America) and the vertebrate host of Sin Nombre virus, the deer mouse,  _Peromyscus maniculatus_, does not occur in India.

CONTEXT: If medical personnel are leaving the area; the signs of  illness are not compatible with those associated with hantavirus  infections; Sin Nombre virus is being provisionally considered as the  etiologic agent; no agent has been clearly defined; cerebral malaria has  not been ruled out; and everyone has a different hypothesis, the situation  could not be worse: anarchic.

CONTEXT: [Sin Nombre virus is the virus without a name, so the diagnosis could have  an etymological basis at least.

ANSWER: FMD
CONTEXT: [From a previous post:"It seems to me that with the enormous increase in  movement of people and animals that takes place, the concept of controlling  FMD by the elaborate rituals to assure FMD-free countries is no longer  tenable or appropriate.

CONTEXT: I also draw to your attention the fact that FMD is spectacularly infectious  and particularly unpleasant.

CONTEXT: It should also be pointed out that  it is the first significant outbreak since 1967, and other countries have  been more successful in maintaining FMD-free status.

CONTEXT: It is  thus clear that maintaining FMD-free status is a reasonable, even sensible,  long-term technique.

CONTEXT: It has become clear that the UK has been importing significant animal  products from areas where FMD is known to be endemic.

CONTEXT: I think it is highly likely that very many  in the UK will demand the banning of animal products from countries where  FMD is endemic.

CONTEXT: The contrast between the continued long-term export of meat products from  countries where FMD is endemic and the immediate banning of all UK produce  almost world-wide after one or two cases has been noted.

CONTEXT: The banning (which  is already in place in many countries as I understand it) of importation of  animal products from countries where FMD is endemic would put further  pressure on these countries to eradicate the disease (possibly with outside  assistance).

CONTEXT: There can be little doubt that this would be beneficial to worldwide animal  health, animal welfare, and the economies of those countries suffering from  the ravages of FMD, many of whom have many small peasant farmers, to whom  FMD must be particularly devastating.

CONTEXT: As expected, I have received many messages which together underline the  complexity of the epidemiology and politics of foot-and-mouth disease  (FMD).

CONTEXT: The use of ring vaccination [i.e., vaccinating susceptible animals  surrounding the known infected focus, sort of a "cordon sanitaire"] in  conjunction with a slaughter policy successfully eradicated FMD from  Western Europe and most of [what was then colonial] Africa .

CONTEXT: As a  consequence, research on vaccines in the UK was downgraded because FMD was  no longer considered a threat.

CONTEXT: [Many of us know outstanding British FMD  scientists who became what is known as "redundant" and migrated to the US]  The US does not have an abiding interest in FMD.

CONTEXT: [The Brits might now consider calling it "Foot-in-Mouth disease]  The re-emergence of FMD is a consequence of the globalization of trade and  the cheap food policies adopted by European governments after WWII.

CONTEXT: At the recent International Congress of Virology held in Sydney, Fred Brown  and Marc van Regenmortel described a very promising development in FMDV  vaccine research.

CONTEXT: There is a widely used and effective vaccine for FMD.

CONTEXT: There are also  vaccines prepared from several different strains of FMD that could be used  to protect against the pan-Asia strain of FMDV.

CONTEXT: As far as I know, the UK  has never utilized vaccines to FMD, even in the 1967 outbreak.

CONTEXT: The reason  for this include: (1) in the past the vaccines had occasionally been shown  to be contaminated with live virus, so those vaccines themselves could  cause FMD (this has been largely controlled recently, and I am sure that  vaccines made by the large multi-nationals are completely safe); (2)  vaccinated animals may be difficult to distinguish serologically from  previously infected animals (eliminating serology as a method of  identifying infected animals); (3) while attempting to "emergency  vaccinate" animals, the vaccination teams can spread disease; (4) and (in  my opinion) most importantly, vaccinated animals may be come infected, and  show less severe signs of disease, despite shedding virus, thus prolonging  an outbreak by allowing infected animals to escape ready visual detection.

CONTEXT: It was on the Island of Reims, just outside  Greifswald, where Friedrich Loeffler and his associates did the first work  with FMD.

ANSWER: type 1 polioviruses
CONTEXT: Characterization of isolates from the 3 patients revealed type 1 polioviruses derived from Sabin vaccine strain type 1, with a 3% genetic sequence difference between Sabin 1 vaccine and vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) isolates.

ANSWER: vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) isolates
CONTEXT: Characterization of isolates from the 3 patients revealed type 1 polioviruses derived from Sabin vaccine strain type 1, with a 3% genetic sequence difference between Sabin 1 vaccine and vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) isolates.

ANSWER: cVDPV outbreaks
CONTEXT: Following cVDPV outbreaks in the Dominican Republic and Haiti (Hispaniola) during 2000--2001 (1), the global polio laboratory network implemented additional testing requirements for all polioviruses under investigation, prospectively and retrospectively.

ANSWER: all polioviruses
CONTEXT: Following cVDPV outbreaks in the Dominican Republic and Haiti (Hispaniola) during 2000--2001 (1), the global polio laboratory network implemented additional testing requirements for all polioviruses under investigation, prospectively and retrospectively.

ANSWER: cVDPVs
CONTEXT: Retrospective testing of 2000 vaccine-related isolates from AFP cases globally has revealed no additional cVDPVs, although testing results of other isolates in the laboratory network are pending.

CONTEXT: The cVDPVs from the Philippines were detected after the implementation of new testing requirements for prospective virus investigations.

CONTEXT: The cVDPVs from the Philippines were detected after the implementation of new testing requirements for prospective virus investigations.

CONTEXT: In response to these cases, the Department of Health in the Philippines 1) enhanced surveillance by active record review for AFP cases in hospitals and other health-care facilities in the affected and neighboring provinces, 2) established surveillance to conduct virologic investigations of aseptic meningitis at major health-care facilities, 3) collected stool samples from healthy contacts of case-patients, 4) conducted field investigations of clustered AFP cases to determine the extent of cVDPV circulation, and 5) assessed polio vaccination coverage in these communities.

CONTEXT: To interrupt cVDPV circulation, a large-scale mass vaccination campaign with OPV is planned.

CONTEXT: Low routine vaccination coverage is one of the most important causes of VDPV.

CONTEXT: Because the location of the originating events is unknown, the contribution of other factors is difficult to assess; however, a combination of 2 concurrent events within the virus is necessary for cVDPV emergence: reversion of attenuating mutations to increase neurovirulence, and a presumed increase in transmission characteristics that might be related to recombination with a nonpolio enterovirus.

CONTEXT: Among the areas covered were Cebu, Davao, Manila, and parts of Mindanao; however, coverage did not extend to the 3 provinces now reporting cVDPV cases.

CONTEXT: [This is now the third documented episode of poliomyelitis-like illness (acute flaccid paralysis - AFP) due to circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) with reversion to neurovirulence.

CONTEXT: The former seems to be preliminarily ruled out by the failure of a retrospective study of over 2000 AFP associated poliovirus isolates to identify additional VDPV, albeit if it is a low level occurrence, we may miss it by virtue of the rarity of the event.

CONTEXT: The occurrence of cVDPV in association with clinical disease is very disturbing as it adds another factor into the risk benefit equation of vaccination recommendations.

CONTEXT: The occurrence of cVDPV in association with clinical disease is very disturbing as it adds another factor into the risk benefit equation of vaccination recommendations.

ANSWER: cVDPV emergence
CONTEXT: Because the location of the originating events is unknown, the contribution of other factors is difficult to assess; however, a combination of 2 concurrent events within the virus is necessary for cVDPV emergence: reversion of attenuating mutations to increase neurovirulence, and a presumed increase in transmission characteristics that might be related to recombination with a nonpolio enterovirus.

CONTEXT: Public Health Dispatch: Acute Flaccid Paralysis Associated with Circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus --- Philippines, 2001 Three cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) isolates were reported in the Philippines during March 15--July 26, 2001.

CONTEXT: Following cVDPV outbreaks in the Dominican Republic and Haiti (Hispaniola) during 2000--2001 (1), the global polio laboratory network implemented additional testing requirements for all polioviruses under investigation, prospectively and retrospectively.

CONTEXT: Retrospective testing of 2000 vaccine-related isolates from AFP cases globally has revealed no additional cVDPVs, although testing results of other isolates in the laboratory network are pending.

CONTEXT: The cVDPVs from the Philippines were detected after the implementation of new testing requirements for prospective virus investigations.

CONTEXT: In response to these cases, the Department of Health in the Philippines 1) enhanced surveillance by active record review for AFP cases in hospitals and other health-care facilities in the affected and neighboring provinces, 2) established surveillance to conduct virologic investigations of aseptic meningitis at major health-care facilities, 3) collected stool samples from healthy contacts of case-patients, 4) conducted field investigations of clustered AFP cases to determine the extent of cVDPV circulation, and 5) assessed polio vaccination coverage in these communities.

CONTEXT: To interrupt cVDPV circulation, a large-scale mass vaccination campaign with OPV is planned.

CONTEXT: Because the location of the originating events is unknown, the contribution of other factors is difficult to assess; however, a combination of 2 concurrent events within the virus is necessary for cVDPV emergence: reversion of attenuating mutations to increase neurovirulence, and a presumed increase in transmission characteristics that might be related to recombination with a nonpolio enterovirus.

CONTEXT: Among the areas covered were Cebu, Davao, Manila, and parts of Mindanao; however, coverage did not extend to the 3 provinces now reporting cVDPV cases.

CONTEXT: [This is now the third documented episode of poliomyelitis-like illness (acute flaccid paralysis - AFP) due to circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) with reversion to neurovirulence.

CONTEXT: The occurrence of cVDPV in association with clinical disease is very disturbing as it adds another factor into the risk benefit equation of vaccination recommendations.

CONTEXT: Because the location of the originating events is unknown, the contribution of other factors is difficult to assess; however, a combination of 2 concurrent events within the virus is necessary for cVDPV emergence: reversion of attenuating mutations to increase neurovirulence, and a presumed increase in transmission characteristics that might be related to recombination with a nonpolio enterovirus.

CONTEXT: Among the areas covered were Cebu, Davao, Manila, and parts of Mindanao; however, coverage did not extend to the 3 provinces now reporting cVDPV cases.

CONTEXT: [This is now the third documented episode of poliomyelitis-like illness (acute flaccid paralysis - AFP) due to circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) with reversion to neurovirulence.

CONTEXT: The occurrence of cVDPV in association with clinical disease is very disturbing as it adds another factor into the risk benefit equation of vaccination recommendations.

ANSWER: anthrax
CONTEXT: Sent: Thu 20 Dec 2001 7:52 AM From: JoeParrish <JoeParrish@compuserve.com> Source: ENVIRONMENT NEWS SERVICE (ENS) [edited] <http://ens-news.com/ens/dec2001/2001L-12-19-06.html> WASHINGTON DC, 19 Dec 2001 (ENS): Members of congress and others who may  have been exposed to anthrax from contaminated letters will be offered a  controversial anthrax vaccine, the United States Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) said on Tuesday.

CONTEXT: Many of those who were exposed to anthrax spores are now finishing a 60 day  course of antibiotics.

CONTEXT: But some animal studies suggest that anthrax spores  could continue to survive within the lungs of exposed people, even after 60  days of antibiotic treatment.

CONTEXT: HHS is providing 2 additional options beyond  the 60 day course for those who may wish to pursue them: an extended course  of antibiotics, and experimental treatment with the anthrax vaccine.

CONTEXT: The  vaccine, developed for use by military personnel who could be exposed to  weapons-grade anthrax in the field, is only intended to protect people who  are immunized before exposure.

CONTEXT: In addition, the agency feels the chance of  anyone developing anthrax this long after exposure is very low.

CONTEXT: The HHS has paid the Department of Defense $598 000 for about 219 000 doses  of the anthrax vaccine, but expects to use fewer than 3000.

CONTEXT: People exposed to high doses may still have  potentially deadly anthrax spores in their lungs after taking the  recommended 60-day course of antibiotics.

CONTEXT: As many as 3000 people are at the  highest risk of having lingering spores and might be candidates for an  anthrax vaccine, officials said."

CONTEXT: The researchers found that the  acellular vaccine, which is very similar if not identical to the one in use  today, gave poor protection against most strains of anthrax except the  Vollum and Vollum 1B strains, against which protection was 100 per cent.

CONTEXT: It  gave no protection at all against the Ames strain, which is the same one  used for the recent anthrax attacks.

ANSWER: BSE
CONTEXT: Note on suspicion of a milk replacement as possible source of BSE, Denmark -------------------------------------------------------------------------- .

CONTEXT: Milk replacements: The Plant Directorate investigates possible sources of infections from feed  in all BSE positive cases in Denmark and has so far finished detailed  reports on the first 3 cases out of 7 in total.

CONTEXT: It appears from the report on the 3rd case that the only feed, which has  been used in all 3 BSE-positive herds, is the milk replacement "Sundkalv"  produced by the firm "Nordmilch EG", Germany, but that contamination with  meat and bone meal (MBM) in other feed products used in the herds cannot be  ruled out.

CONTEXT: At the  time of production of the batches of milk replacements that were used in  BSE infected herds, it was not obligatory to remove specified risk material  (SRM) in the slaughterhouses in all EU member states.

CONTEXT: Therefore there is a  risk that the product might have been contaminated with fat produced from  parts of spinal cord and brain from BSE positive cattle.

CONTEXT: Denmark's BSE reference laboratory, The Danish Veterinary Laboratory (DVL),  is currently conducting a risk evaluation on the use of animal fat as feed  for ruminants and the risk entailed using the milk replacements on the  market in Denmark.

CONTEXT: Furthermore, DVL is working on an epidemiological project regarding the  possible causal association of BSE and milk replacements.

CONTEXT: If the product in  question has been used by most of the Danish farmers, there is not  necessarily a causal relation between a case of BSE and the use of this  milk replacement on the farm.

CONTEXT: Furthermore reference is made to an article in Deutsche Tierarztliche  Wochenschrift, no 7 from Jul 2001 on feed ingredients, including fat, and  their potential role in the spread of BSE.

CONTEXT: From the reports on the first 3 BSE cases made by the Plant Directorate,  it appears that cross contamination with MBM cannot be ruled out as a  possible source of infection.

CONTEXT: Denmark has so far had 7 cases of BSE in cattle born in Denmark.

CONTEXT: Conclusions: The following possibilities for infection with BSE cannot be ruled out with  regard to the first 7 cases of BSE in Denmark: 1.

CONTEXT: [The appearance of BSE in Denmark, a country which officially banned the  import of MBMs since 1933, is of particular interest.

CONTEXT: According to the  Danish data <http://www.vfd.dk/java_enab/f_uk.html>, Denmark has carried  out 255 951 BSE tests from Jan to Nov 2001, including 17 836 in fallen  stock (2 positive); 1682 in emergency slaughtered bovines (all negative);  232 167 tests in healthy slaughtered bovines (3 BSE positive); and 12 tests  in clinically suspected cases (1 positive).

CONTEXT: The presented Danish notes, kindly forwarded to ProMED by the Danish  Veterinary and Food Administration, are valuable also for the assessment of  BSE cases in countries which have been regarded, until recently, to have a  low risk status and for the evaluation of possible BSE cases appearing in  additional countries of the same Geographic BSE Risk (GBR) status.

CONTEXT: Though  not (yet) conclusive, the Danish notes are highlighting again the  significant role which cross contamination in EU slaughterhouses has played  in the dissemination of BSE by means of infected feed, with special  emphasis upon the possible involvement of fat included in milk  replacements.

CONTEXT: The reader may recollect the Japanese publications,  circulated by ProMED on 12 Dec 2001, reporting that all 3 Holstein cows,  recently found BSE positive there, had consumed a milk replacement (in this  case -- according to the media -- the included animal fat was produced in  the Netherlands).

CONTEXT: Similar investigations in other countries which have been previously  regarded as belonging to GBR of "category II", namely where "BSE is  unlikely but it cannot be excluded that cattle is infected (clinical or  sub-clinical) with the BSE agent" are highly desirable.

CONTEXT: Such countries as  Finland and Austria might add missing links and enable reaching final  conclusions related to the potential role of milk replacements in the  recent, current, or potential future spread of BSE.

ANSWER: TSE
CONTEXT: ************************************************* A PrOMED-mail post <http://www.promedmail.org> ProMED-mail, a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases <http://www.isid.org> It is curious that the distribution of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) in Nebraska (NE) deer is in proximity to only one of 2 areas of TSE occurrence.

CONTEXT: It raises the question posed below: We understand that the available evidence from sheep, deer, and elk suggest at least 2 separate factors: genetics and some type of contact transmission (possibly even a low-level sexually transmitted disease-type prion 'infectivity') are necessary to explain the occurrence of TSE in these wild populations.

CONTEXT: Why is there no TSE (so far) in the wild herds in Sioux County?

ANSWER: Eastern Equine Encephalopathy (EEE)
CONTEXT: Full results of the investigation into the first recorded case of  Eastern Equine Encephalopathy (EEE) in California are now available  at the above URL.

ANSWER: EEEV (Easter Equine Encephalitis Virus)
ANSWER: EEE
CONTEXT: Full results of the investigation into the first recorded case of  Eastern Equine Encephalopathy (EEE) in California are now available  at the above URL.

CONTEXT: The following is a portion of the conclusions: After we excluded disease by natural infection, bioterrorism, and  importation, incomplete formalin inactivation of the EEEV (Easter  Equine Encephalitis Virus) in the vaccine had to be considered a  likely possibility.

CONTEXT: Attempts to isolate live EEEV from residual and stored vaccine were  unsuccessful.

CONTEXT: Unfortunately, the North American  variety of EEEV  is the most genetically homologous of the  alphaviruses and therefore the least conducive to molecular  comparison of strains (9,22).

CONTEXT: Differences among sequences from Vaccine A EEEV and the horse viral  isolate in the  E1 region might represent mutations that occurred  when virus passed through various hosts (horse brain/BHK cell  culture/1) or genetic variants within the vaccine strain.

CONTEXT: However, we  concluded on the basis of the limited number of clones analyzed that  there were few to no other EEEV subclones in the horse viral isolate  or vaccine virus.

CONTEXT: Also, very few EEEV sequences that  included the nonstructural regions have been published in GenBank, so  comparison was limited.

CONTEXT: Regardless, the Vaccine A EEEV appears to be  closely related to the horse viral isolate; thus, the possibility  of  live virus in the formalin-treated vaccine infecting the horse  remains.

ANSWER: virulent APMV-1 viruses
CONTEXT: It is now broadly accepted that virulent APMV-1 viruses generally arise in  poultry by mutation of viruses of low virulence after these viruses have  been introduced into poultry flocks (Alexander DJ, British Poultry Science  42, 5-22, 2001).

ANSWER: this ND virus
CONTEXT: Since this ND virus reported from Victoria is almost  identical to the 1999 Mangrove Mountain isolate, then it appears more than  a remote probability that the same precursor virus (so-called Peat's Ridge  strain) may have been present in these Victorian flocks for some time and a  very similar mutation event has resulted in this virulent virus.

ANSWER: Newcastle disease virus
CONTEXT: [Newcastle disease virus is a notoriously variable virus.

CONTEXT: Strains of  Newcastle disease virus differ widely in virulence, depending on the  cleavability and activation of their hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion  membrane proteins.

CONTEXT: This is the basis for the  definition of strains of Newcastle disease virus as velogenic (or  viscerotropic), mesogenic, or lentogenic for strains of high, intermediate,  or low virulence, respectively.

ANSWER: ND
CONTEXT: Since this ND virus reported from Victoria is almost  identical to the 1999 Mangrove Mountain isolate, then it appears more than  a remote probability that the same precursor virus (so-called Peat's Ridge  strain) may have been present in these Victorian flocks for some time and a  very similar mutation event has resulted in this virulent virus.

CONTEXT: For countries or regions claiming ND freedom, this outbreak again  underlines the need for continuous serosurveillance of poultry flocks with  immediate epidemiological investigation (including attempts to isolate and  classify any APMV-1 viruses circulating) at the first sign of  seroconversion in flocks.

ANSWER: Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
CONTEXT: Increased Incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in Switzerland --------------------------------------------------------------- .

ANSWER: [sporadic] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
CONTEXT: In the 13 Jul 2002 issue of the Lancet, Markus Glatzel, Colette Rogivue,  Azra Ghani, Johannes R Streffer, Lorenz Amsler and Adriano Aguzzi  report  an increase in the incidence of [sporadic] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)  in Switzerland.

ANSWER: CJD
CONTEXT: In the 13 Jul 2002 issue of the Lancet, Markus Glatzel, Colette Rogivue,  Azra Ghani, Johannes R Streffer, Lorenz Amsler and Adriano Aguzzi  report  an increase in the incidence of [sporadic] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)  in Switzerland.

CONTEXT: The abstract of their research letter reads as follows: "  The incidence of CJD in Switzerland increased two-fold in 2001, and figures  from the first quarter of 2002 indicate that it continues to rise.

CONTEXT: None of the recognized risk  factors for acquired CJD were reported on the official notification forms.

CONTEXT: Glycotype profiling, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry indicate that  none of the cases fulfilled the definition of variant CJD, which is thought  to be caused by bovine prions.

CONTEXT: Several scenarios could account for the  increase in CJD, including improved reporting, iatrogenic transmission, and  transmission of a prion zoonosis."

CONTEXT: [Sporadic CJD is evenly distributed worldwide, with an incidence of about  one in a million per year.

CONTEXT: The authors  consider that the relatively large number of individuals with CJD in 2001,  compared with previous years, is unlikely to be due to chance fluctuation  (Poisson probability 0�004, assuming constant incidence), and the quarterly  incidence data are better fit by an increasing exponential trend than by  assuming constant incidence (figure 1, p=0�02).

CONTEXT: The rise in incidence of CJD in Switzerland over the past 2 years could be  a result of ascertainment bias; i.e., increased awareness of the disease  might have led to enhanced detection of CJD in patients who would have  otherwise been misdiagnosed.

CONTEXT: Furthermore, in Switzerland the mere  suspicion, rather than the diagnosis, of CJD became statutorily notifiable  in March, 1999.

CONTEXT: An ascertainment bias hypothesis would postulate that  the true average incidence of sporadic CJD is 3 or more per million per  year, indicating that all countries other than Switzerland are  under-reporting by more than 50% the number of CJD patients diagnosed every  year.

CONTEXT: Genetic inheritance of CJD is unlikely to have contributed to the rise in  mortality from this disease, since familial instances of CJD co-segregate  with PRNP mutations, and the authors considered this explanation  incompatible with their data.

CONTEXT: One PRNP allele had a mutation associated  with hereditary dominant CJD; all other sequenced alleles had wild-type  sequences.

CONTEXT: The type 4 glycotype of the disease-associated prion protein  PrPSc  which is characteristic of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy)  and vCJD was absent.

CONTEXT: Cortical florid PrP plaques  characteristic of vCJD  were not observed.

CONTEXT: Finally the authors consider the possibility that CJD in Switzerland is  related to a prion epizootic, and pay considerable attention to this  possibility since between 1995 and 1998, Switzerland reported a larger  incidence of BSE than did all other continental European countries (415  cases between 1990 and 2002).

CONTEXT: However, BSE is thought to cause variant CJD  [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail] rather than sporadic  CJD, yet all evidence indicates that none of the Swiss cases fulfill the  diagnostic criteria of vCJD.

CONTEXT: Swiss CJD could be related to BSE only if the  strain of Swiss BSE prion differs from the strain of BSE prevalent in the  UK.

CONTEXT: At present there is no evidence that the Swiss CJD cases might result from  transmission of BSE to people after one or more serial passages through  species other than cattle.

CONTEXT: All recognized clinical and molecular markers combine to indicate that none  of the Swiss patients developed vCJD.

CONTEXT: It remains to be seen whether this increase in the  incidence of CJD in Switzerland will be sustained, or whether it represent  a statistical anomaly.

CONTEXT: (Ann Neurol 1998; 43:  763-767) there was a doubling in the annual death rates for sporadic CJD in  the United Kingdom between the 1980s and the 1990s, and similar increases  in the apparent death rates for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease had  occurred in other European countries, attributable to  improvement in  diagnosis.

ANSWER: Sporadic CJD
CONTEXT: [Sporadic CJD is evenly distributed worldwide, with an incidence of about  one in a million per year.

ANSWER: hereditary dominant CJD
CONTEXT: One PRNP allele had a mutation associated  with hereditary dominant CJD; all other sequenced alleles had wild-type  sequences.

ANSWER: Swiss CJD
CONTEXT: Swiss CJD could be related to BSE only if the  strain of Swiss BSE prion differs from the strain of BSE prevalent in the  UK.

CONTEXT: At present there is no evidence that the Swiss CJD cases might result from  transmission of BSE to people after one or more serial passages through  species other than cattle.

ANSWER: BSE
CONTEXT: In the ProMED post "BSE-Japan (04)" on 22 Aug 2002, the moderator stated the results of the investigation by the Japanese delegation to the Netherlands regarding the animal fat have not been disclosed.

CONTEXT: The animal fat exported to Japan was used to feed some of the BSE cases in the Netherlands, but the same manufacturer has a [market?] share of over 50 percent in the Netherlands, and millions of calves have been fed the animal fat produced by this manufacturer.

CONTEXT: Therefore, they insisted that no epidemiological  relationship between the milk replacer and BSE can be observed.

CONTEXT: Based on these results, the report concluded that they could not obtain evidence for contamination of the animal fat by animal protein that can cause BSE.

ANSWER: malaria
CONTEXT: A military team of malaria experts has found 2 pools of malaria-carrying mosquitoes on a Maryland island in the Potomac River near Loudoun County, offering the first independent confirmation that the infected insects appear to be in the Washington area, health officials said yesterday.

CONTEXT: But Wirtz said the polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test used in Maryland, in which genetic material is amplified to make it easier to find the malaria parasite's DNA, has long proven reliable.

CONTEXT: Wirtz said it's likely that people who picked up malaria overseas are in the area and that they had infected the mosquitoes.

CONTEXT: Also, while it is rare to see so many malaria-carrying mosquitoes in one place in the United States, it could happen, he added.

CONTEXT: Agricultural laborers who work daily on Selden Island, which is privately owned, will be contacted today and could be tested for malaria, Loudoun County Health Director David Goodfriend said.

CONTEXT: It has been decades since mosquitoes testing positive for malaria have been found in the United States near where humans have been infected, as 2 Loudoun teenagers were during the summer, researchers said.

CONTEXT: She said the increasing globalization of the Washington area -- with its many travellers and residents from countries with widespread malaria -- probably [accounts] for the rare occurrence of infected mosquitoes.

CONTEXT: The latest findings have revived debate about whether spraying for adult mosquitoes would help reduce risk for malaria.

CONTEXT: But officials are waiting for confirmation of earlier tests showing malaria-infected mosquitoes in Loudoun and Fairfax, and they are hoping for cooler temperatures.

CONTEXT: Since then, contractor Clarke Environmental Mosquito Control reported discovering 3 pools of malaria-infected mosquitoes, one near the Lansdowne resort south of Leesburg, one 2 miles away along a waterway called Broad Run, and one in Herndon.

CONTEXT: Federal researchers had cast doubts on the results, saying they suggested that parts of Northern Virginia have higher proportions of infected mosquitoes than some developing countries with endemic malaria -- a highly unlikely circumstance.

CONTEXT: There is no indication that spraying now on the Maryland mainland would reduce the very low risk of contracting malaria, said Garvey, the county health officer.

CONTEXT: [It is no surprise that a few mosquitoes are malaria-positive in an area where 2 people were infected by mosquito bites.

CONTEXT: If several pools of malaria-positive mosquitoes are identified, it probably means that the human source of the _P.vivax_ infection is present in the area, and surveys for gametocyte carriers among immigrants from _P.vivax_-endemic countries may be necessary.

ANSWER: _P.vivax_ infection

ANSWER: EHD
CONTEXT: ********************************************* A ProMED-mail, post <http://www.promedmail.org> ProMED-mail, a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases <http://www.isid.org> Game Commission Releases Test Results  Proving EHD Caused Deer Deaths in  Southwest ---------------------------- Pennsylvania Game Commission Bureau of Wildlife Management Director Calvin  DuBrock today announced that test results from one deer found dead in  Franklin Township, Greene County, proved that its death was caused by  epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD).

CONTEXT: EHD also was  confirmed earlier this year in Maryland, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

CONTEXT: "While we await test results from the other 5 samples sent, we are  relatively certain that they also died of EHD, which was recently confirmed  across the state border in West Virginia," DuBrock said.

CONTEXT: "Hunters need to  know that, according to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease  Study, EHD cannot be contracted by humans."

CONTEXT: In  addition, he added there is no evidence the EHD virus is spread through  consumption of venison, or that the meat is even affected.

CONTEXT: EHD is a common disease in white-tailed deer populations of the United  States, and is [transmitted through] the bite of insects called "biting  midges."

CONTEXT: In northern states, EHD usually kills the animal within 5 to 10  days, but is not spread from deer to deer by contact.

CONTEXT: While EHD is not  infectious to humans, deer displaying severe symptoms of EHD may not be  suitable for consumption.

CONTEXT: DuBrock stressed that even though some EHD symptoms are similar to those of  chronic wasting disease (CWD) -- such as excessive drooling,  unconsciousness and a loss of fear of humans -- there is no relationship  between EHD and CWD.

CONTEXT: DuBrock also pointed out that the EHD outbreak should have been squelched  by the recent cold weather and icing conditions, which will kill the  insects that spread the disease.

CONTEXT: He noted that EHD, unlike CWD, is a  seasonal disease and the affected local deer herd will rebound quickly.

CONTEXT: In 1996, EHD was suspected to be the cause of death in nearly 25 deer in  Adams County.

ANSWER: rabies
CONTEXT: A man has been admitted to hospital in Scotland with an acute neurological  illness that is being investigated as a suspected case of rabies (1,2).

CONTEXT: The  possible diagnosis of a rabies-like illness is being considered because of  some aspects of the clinical presentation and because the man is a bat  handler who has been bitten by a bat in Scotland on at least one occasion  within the possible incubation period for rabies.

CONTEXT: There is no documented  evidence that the patient has ever received rabies immunisation or has  travelled abroad since 1996.

CONTEXT: Although the clinical features of the man's  illness are compatible with some aspects of rabies, none of the laboratory  investigations yet indicates that a rabies-like virus is responsible.

CONTEXT: Testing for rabies and rabies-like virus is not, however, straightforward  and more tests are being undertaken.

CONTEXT: The case has raised awareness of the  possibility of rabies-like virus infection of bats in the United Kingdom  (UK) (3).

CONTEXT: European bat lyssavirus: The rabies-like viruses carried by insectivorous bats in Europe are  referred to as European bat lyssaviruses (EBLs).

CONTEXT: These are from the same  family of viruses that cause rabies in terrestrial mammals and in bats in  the Americas, but differ in genotype and serotype.

CONTEXT: They are EBL 1 and 2,  and are of rabies virus genotype 5 and 6, respectively.

CONTEXT: Classical rabies is  due to rabies virus genotype 1.

CONTEXT: Both of these bat rabies infections were  in the same species -- the Daubenton's bat.

CONTEXT: The risk of EBL infection being passed to domestic pets such  as dogs and cats, and to wild terrestrial mammals, is very low, and the  rabies-free status of the UK has been unaffected by the previous isolation  of EBL in 2 bats in the UK.

CONTEXT: The  different rabies-like viruses and bat species found in Europe distinguish  this region from the Americas, where the risk of rabies following human  contact with bats is higher (14).

CONTEXT: The Department of Health for England has advised that  all bat handlers, whether licensed or not, should have pre-exposure  immunization against rabies (15).

CONTEXT: Bat handlers should have booster rabies  vaccination every 3 to 5 years.

CONTEXT: Prophylaxis for exposure to EBL is the same as that recommended for  other potential rabies virus exposures and appears to be highly effective  (16).

CONTEXT: There, as in the UK, people who have been bitten  by an EBL virus-positive bat are advised to be vaccinated with rabies  vaccine as for classical (genotype 1) strains.

CONTEXT: It has been shown that there  is cross-immunity between genotype 1 and genotype 5 (EBL 1) and genotype 6  (EBL 2) strains (18), but it is not known whether rabies vaccines are  completely protective against EBLs.

CONTEXT: Over the last 2 decades several hundred  people in the Netherlands have been vaccinated with genotype 1 rabies virus  vaccines after being bitten by an EBL-positive bat, and no EBL infection  has ever been confirmed in a human being in the Netherlands (WHM van der  Poel, personal communication, 20 Nov 2002).

CONTEXT: If the person is  already fully immunised against rabies, they should be offered 2 doses of  vaccine.

CONTEXT: For those who were previously  unimmunised, and who have been bitten by a bat that is known, or strongly  suspected, to be rabid, rabies immunoglobulin may be offered in addition to  a full course of vaccine.

CONTEXT: In view of the occasionally prolonged incubation  period of rabies, post-exposure vaccination should also be offered to any  individuals who have been exposed to bats as described above at any point  in the last year if they did not receive post-exposure vaccination at the  time of the incident.

CONTEXT: Possible rabies-like infection in Scotland.

CONTEXT: Suspected rabies case in Tayside.

CONTEXT: Suspected case of bat rabies in Lancashire.

CONTEXT: Bat brings rabies to Britain.

CONTEXT: A case of bat rabies in Lancashire.

CONTEXT: Sporadic case of bat rabies in the United Kingdom.

CONTEXT: The  location of the 2002 Lancashire case is, however, more consistent with EBLs  being present in a bat species in the UK.

CONTEXT: EBLs do not readily cross the species barrier, and even in parts of Europe  where bats are known to carry EBLs, it is very rare for other animals to be  infected (9).

CONTEXT: Experience has been gained in The Netherlands,  where EBLs are prevalent.

CONTEXT: It has been shown that there  is cross-immunity between genotype 1 and genotype 5 (EBL 1) and genotype 6  (EBL 2) strains (18), but it is not known whether rabies vaccines are  completely protective against EBLs.

ANSWER: EBL
CONTEXT: European bat lyssavirus: The rabies-like viruses carried by insectivorous bats in Europe are  referred to as European bat lyssaviruses (EBLs).

CONTEXT: They are EBL 1 and 2,  and are of rabies virus genotype 5 and 6, respectively.

CONTEXT: Between 1977 and 2000, 630 cases of EBL  infection in bats were reported in Europe, mostly in Denmark, the  Netherlands, and Germany (4).

CONTEXT: Only 2 EBL infections have been confirmed in  UK bats: one on the south coast of England in 1996 (5) and another in  northwest England in 2002 (6,7).

CONTEXT: The  location of the 2002 Lancashire case is, however, more consistent with EBLs  being present in a bat species in the UK.

CONTEXT: The Veterinary Laboratories  Agency in the UK tests about 200 bats every year for EBL, but has not so  far detected the virus other than the 2 cases in 1996 and 2002 (8).

CONTEXT: EBLs do not readily cross the species barrier, and even in parts of Europe  where bats are known to carry EBLs, it is very rare for other animals to be  infected (9).

CONTEXT: The risk of EBL infection being passed to domestic pets such  as dogs and cats, and to wild terrestrial mammals, is very low, and the  rabies-free status of the UK has been unaffected by the previous isolation  of EBL in 2 bats in the UK.

CONTEXT: As EBL does not transmit readily to other species, infection in humans is  extremely rare.

CONTEXT: Prophylaxis for exposure to EBL is the same as that recommended for  other potential rabies virus exposures and appears to be highly effective  (16).

CONTEXT: Experience has been gained in The Netherlands,  where EBLs are prevalent.

CONTEXT: There, as in the UK, people who have been bitten  by an EBL virus-positive bat are advised to be vaccinated with rabies  vaccine as for classical (genotype 1) strains.

CONTEXT: It has been shown that there  is cross-immunity between genotype 1 and genotype 5 (EBL 1) and genotype 6  (EBL 2) strains (18), but it is not known whether rabies vaccines are  completely protective against EBLs.

CONTEXT: Over the last 2 decades several hundred  people in the Netherlands have been vaccinated with genotype 1 rabies virus  vaccines after being bitten by an EBL-positive bat, and no EBL infection  has ever been confirmed in a human being in the Netherlands (WHM van der  Poel, personal communication, 20 Nov 2002).

CONTEXT: A new case of European bat lyassavirus  (EBL) infection in Danish sheep.

CONTEXT: Prevention of European bat lyssavirus infection in humans: Bats present virtually no risk to the general public and are protected by  law in the UK.

ANSWER: rabies-like virus
CONTEXT: Although the clinical features of the man's  illness are compatible with some aspects of rabies, none of the laboratory  investigations yet indicates that a rabies-like virus is responsible.

CONTEXT: Testing for rabies and rabies-like virus is not, however, straightforward  and more tests are being undertaken.

CONTEXT: The case has raised awareness of the  possibility of rabies-like virus infection of bats in the United Kingdom  (UK) (3).

CONTEXT: European bat lyssavirus: The rabies-like viruses carried by insectivorous bats in Europe are  referred to as European bat lyssaviruses (EBLs).

CONTEXT: The  different rabies-like viruses and bat species found in Europe distinguish  this region from the Americas, where the risk of rabies following human  contact with bats is higher (14).

ANSWER: West Nile virus (WNV)
CONTEXT: SANTO DOMINGO: The Ministry of Health issued an epidemiologic alert  yesterday for febrile illnesses in humans after finding antibodies against  West Nile virus (WNV) in birds in the Los Haitises National Park.

ANSWER: West Nile virus infection
ANSWER: WNV
CONTEXT: SANTO DOMINGO: The Ministry of Health issued an epidemiologic alert  yesterday for febrile illnesses in humans after finding antibodies against  West Nile virus (WNV) in birds in the Los Haitises National Park.

CONTEXT: The country has also issued alerts to the Ministries  of Health of surrounding countries, as this is the first finding of WNV  outside of the continental territory of the United States [this should  state continental North America as the virus has been identified in Canada  in 2002, and in the past several days in Northern Mexico near the border  with the USA [see ProMED-mail posting: West Nile virus, birds - Mexico  (north)20030315.0640.

CONTEXT: - Mod.MPP] and therefore its [WNV] behavior in the  region is not yet known.

CONTEXT: The virus was identified for the first time in Uganda in 1937; in the 1950s  in Europe, and arrived in the United States in 1999 where during last year  [2002] there were 4000 cases reported in humans, of which there were 266  deaths associated with WNV infection.

CONTEXT: [There were 4161 cases and 277 deaths  reported to have occurred in the USA during 2002 as of data available on  the CDC WNV website current to 13 Mar 2003  <http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/wncount.htm> - Mod.MPP] The health authorities stated that a laboratory analysis conducted in the  United States last February [2003?], confirmed that some blood specimens  collected in November [2002?] from birds in the Los Haitises National Park  had specific antibodies against WNV.

CONTEXT: This finding demonstrates that WNV  has been transmitted locally to birds resident in the  country.

CONTEXT: The director of CENCET presumes that WNV arrived [in the Dominican  Republic] with these migratory birds from other infected  countries.

CONTEXT: These specimens were sent to the CDC  laboratory, and nine of the specimens collected were positive for  flaviviruses, and five of these were confirmed to have antibodies against  WNV.

CONTEXT: The virus itself was not isolated, but the detection of specific  antibodies against WNV indicates that WNV is circulating in the Criolle  [local] ecosystem.

CONTEXT: Birds from which the WNV antibodies were identified are  known to inhabit populated areas such as Chuachua.

CONTEXT: [by: Doris Pantaleon] Ornithologists of the University of Kansas in the United States, and at the  National Zoological Park, consider that one of the possible negative  impacts of the appearance of WNV in the Dominican Republic will be the  effect on bird population currently in need of conservation, since many may  become ill and die.

CONTEXT: However, at the present time, there  have been no birds, mammals or human beings identified with illness  associated with WNV infection.

CONTEXT: As of 21 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 9 individuals who  have become ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario  and British Columbia.

ANSWER: SARS
CONTEXT: As of 21 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 9 individuals who  have become ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario  and British Columbia.

CONTEXT: British Columbia: one person has been admitted to hospital with SARS.

CONTEXT: At this time, the cause of SARS remains unknown, but national and  international laboratory testing and collaboration is ongoing.

CONTEXT: These findings will not likely alter  the current treatment for SARS patients.

CONTEXT: However, because of recent  increases in cases of SARS in the city of Hanoi, Vietnam, Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region, and Singapore and that transmission may not be  limited to the hospital setting, Health Canada advises that people planning  elective or nonessential travel to the city of Hanoi, Vietnam, Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region, and Singapore may wish to postpone their  trips until further notice.

CONTEXT: In collaboration with the provinces, territories, and local health units,  Health Canada has begun enhanced surveillance for the recognition of SARS  cases.

CONTEXT: They have  started distributing Health Alert Notices to all passengers arriving in or  returning from Hong Kong and Singapore which will ask passengers to see a  physician if they begin to have any symptoms related to SARS.

CONTEXT: Health Canada continues to provide employer departments with the  most current information and advice available on SARS.

CONTEXT: For additional information on SARS, please contact Health  Canada's information line at: 1-800-454-8302.

CONTEXT: All of these results are suggesting  more and more that the paramxyovirus family may be the etiology of SARS.

ANSWER: Dengue Fever
CONTEXT: Australia: Dengue Fever in Cairns: Update ----------------------------------------- .

ANSWER: dengue
CONTEXT: In this update: [1] [2] & [3] Australia (North Queensland) There are now 85 confirmed cases of dengue fever in Cairns as of 19 Mar  2003.

CONTEXT: No cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) have been reported, but people  who acquired dengue in the last large outbreak in Cairns in 1997-99 would  be at risk of developing haemorrhagic fever if they caught dengue fever  again in this outbreak.

CONTEXT: DHF can occur when a person previously infected  with dengue becomes infected with a different dengue serotype, and is  potentially fatal.

CONTEXT: Travellers to Australia are strongly reminded to take measures to prevent  mosquito bites to protect themselves against dengue fever and other  mosquito borne diseases.

ANSWER: a paramyxovirus
CONTEXT: a paramyxovirus and a coronavirus.

ANSWER: a coronavirus
CONTEXT: a paramyxovirus and a coronavirus.

ANSWER: SARS
CONTEXT: [We are posting this edited version of the most recent WHO update on the  SARS outbreak and investigation as it provides additional background on the  investigations to date along with preliminary interpretations of findings.

CONTEXT: We�ve been able to produce  guidance based on clinical and epidemiological evidence posted on our web  site on the SARS page.We�ve established a logistic basis throughout the  world and worked in close collaboration with bilateral arrangements from a  variety of different countries to ensure that supplies are in place.

CONTEXT: Could you give us an idea of whether  or not it�s possible for a single disease to be caused by 2 viruses or is  it more likely that at least one of the samples might not be related to SARS?

CONTEXT: Suppose  that there were 2 diseases occurring at the same time, SARS and a disease  which causes the same symptoms but is less severe.

CONTEXT: We can only begin to distinguish genuine  SARS cases from other less severe diseases having similar initial symptoms  when we have a diagnostic test.

CONTEXT: As reiterated in the above press statement, to date all indications have  been that transmission of SARS requires close contact with active cases of  SARS, and that generalized spread in the community has not been  detected.

CONTEXT: Almost all cases identified to date can specifically trace their  exposure to another case of SARS, either in the health care environment,  the family or other social environment, or in the Hong Kong tour group  (close contact with an individual who sat next to a probable case who had  visited a hospitalized case).

CONTEXT: A more modest and  defensible conclusion would be that on the basis of  current evidence it is  possible that neither of these 2 candidate etiologic agents are  determinants of SARS.

ANSWER: Paramyxoviruses
CONTEXT: Paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses are fairly benign  ubiquitous residents of the human respiratory tract that might be detected  fortuitously in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

ANSWER: coronaviruses
CONTEXT: Paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses are fairly benign  ubiquitous residents of the human respiratory tract that might be detected  fortuitously in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

ANSWER: the corona virus

ANSWER: SARS
CONTEXT: SARS: Detection of a Coronavirus by Virologists at the Institut Pasteur ------------------------------------------------- .

CONTEXT: A coronavirus has been detected in samples obtained from SARS patients in Hanoi by Sylvie van der Werf and colleagues in the Molecular Genetics of Respiratory Viruses Unit at the Institut Pasteur.

CONTEXT: Van der Werf's group had been invited by the World Health Organisation and the Direction Generale de la Sante francaise (DGS) to participate in the international effort to investigate the nature of the current SARS outbreak in Asia.

CONTEXT: - Mod.CP] Detection of Novel Coronavirus and Human Metapneumovirus Sequences in the Same SARS Patients ------------------ [The following description of the virological investigations in Canadian SARS patients has been extracted from the paper by Poutanen et al., entitled "Identification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Canada" and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.

CONTEXT: It confirms previous statements from Canadian sources that a human metapneumovirus had been isolated from a SARS patient and further appears to indicate the presence of both a novel coronavirus and a human metapneumovirus in 4 of 5 virus-positive SARS patients.

CONTEXT: Human metapneumovirus was amplified by nested PCR from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs from 5 of 9 patients with SARS and from a nasopharyngeal swab from an asymptomatic contact of one of the patients in Toronto (Patient 3) with use of the following primers: 5'CTTTGGACTTAATGACAGATG3' and 5'GTCTTCCTGTGCTAACTTTG3'.

CONTEXT: In addition, a novel coronavirus was isolated from Vero cell cultures inoculated with respiratory specimens from 5 of 9 patients with SARS.

CONTEXT: On the basis of collaboration with investigators in Hong Kong and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who reported isolating a novel coronavirus from patients with SARS in other areas of the world, RT-PCR and nested PCR were completed targeting conserved regions of the coronavirus polymerase gene using the following primer pairs: 5'CAGAGCCATGCCTAACATG3' and 5'AATGTTTACGCAGGTAAGCG3'; and 5'TGTTAAACCAGGTGGAAC3' and 5'CCTGTGTTGTAGATTGCG3'.

CONTEXT: Further studies are currently being completed to determine whether the human metapneumovirus and a novel coronavirus, either alone or in combination, are the cause of SARS or whether other thus-far-undetected pathogens are possibly responsible.

CONTEXT: The possibility cannot be excluded that co-infection by either virus with another agent may be responsible for SARS.

CONTEXT: [Now that a lab test is widely available for the coronavirus that was isolated from 2 SARS patients in Germany, there may be a danger of circular reasoning about the etiology.

CONTEXT: Nobody may be looking at those that test negative to see whether they contain sequences for human metapneumovirus, henipaviruses or other paramyxoviruses (the last do not appear to have been definitely excluded yet -- remember that 3 independent laboratories identified a paramyxovirus from specimens taken from SARS patients).

CONTEXT: One has to bear in mind -- or explain away -- all the conflicting findings, by multiple labs, of viruses from SARS patients that were not coronaviruses.

ANSWER: severe acute respiratory syndrome
CONTEXT: [A report in Europa Press, 31 Mar 2003 <http://www.europapress.es/> (submitted by Pablo Nart and translated by Maria Jacobs, ProMED-ESP) stated in addition that scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris -- presumably those named above -- had identified coronaviruses in samples from 6 patients with atypical pneumonia in the Hanoi Hospital in Vietnam, as well as in samples obtained from a physician hospitalized in Tourcoing (north of France), the first victim of severe acute respiratory syndrome in France.

CONTEXT: Human metapneumovirus was amplified by nested PCR from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs from 5 of 9 patients with SARS and from a nasopharyngeal swab from an asymptomatic contact of one of the patients in Toronto (Patient 3) with use of the following primers: 5'CTTTGGACTTAATGACAGATG3' and 5'GTCTTCCTGTGCTAACTTTG3'.

CONTEXT: In addition, a novel coronavirus was isolated from Vero cell cultures inoculated with respiratory specimens from 5 of 9 patients with SARS.

CONTEXT: On the basis of collaboration with investigators in Hong Kong and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who reported isolating a novel coronavirus from patients with SARS in other areas of the world, RT-PCR and nested PCR were completed targeting conserved regions of the coronavirus polymerase gene using the following primer pairs: 5'CAGAGCCATGCCTAACATG3' and 5'AATGTTTACGCAGGTAAGCG3'; and 5'TGTTAAACCAGGTGGAAC3' and 5'CCTGTGTTGTAGATTGCG3'.

CONTEXT: Further studies are currently being completed to determine whether the human metapneumovirus and a novel coronavirus, either alone or in combination, are the cause of SARS or whether other thus-far-undetected pathogens are possibly responsible.

CONTEXT: The possibility cannot be excluded that co-infection by either virus with another agent may be responsible for SARS.

CONTEXT: [Now that a lab test is widely available for the coronavirus that was isolated from 2 SARS patients in Germany, there may be a danger of circular reasoning about the etiology.

CONTEXT: Nobody may be looking at those that test negative to see whether they contain sequences for human metapneumovirus, henipaviruses or other paramyxoviruses (the last do not appear to have been definitely excluded yet -- remember that 3 independent laboratories identified a paramyxovirus from specimens taken from SARS patients).

CONTEXT: One has to bear in mind -- or explain away -- all the conflicting findings, by multiple labs, of viruses from SARS patients that were not coronaviruses.

CONTEXT: Subsequent to the April 10 report, DNA sequence analysis has confirmed  that the TX END outbreak was caused by a separate introduction of a  related, but distinctly different, END virus strain, not by the movement of  END virus from the affected areas in CA-NV-AZ.

CONTEXT: This information  demonstrates several relevant and important factors: 1) END virus has been contained effectively in the existing quarantine  areas in southern CA, western AZ, and southern NV; and 2) the State-Federal educational and awareness programs and surveillance  efforts are having a positive impact, even outside of the quarantine areas.

CONTEXT: The  sequence of the Texas APMV-1 is compatible with its classification as  exotic Newcastle disease virus (ENDV).

CONTEXT: The sequence at the cleavage site of  the fusion protein gene is RRQKR/F, which is identical with that found in  the CA, NV, and AZ isolates of ENDV.

CONTEXT: The phylogenetic (DNA) analysis of the TX El Paso END virus isolate has  been completed.

CONTEXT: The DNA analysis data along  with other laboratory data support the conclusion that the TX END outbreak  was caused by a separate introduction of END virus and not by movement of  END virus from affected areas in CA, NV, or AZ.

ANSWER: SARS
CONTEXT: In today's update: [1] Worldwide - WHO [2] China - WHO/Beijing Government [3] Taiwan - CDC Taiwan [4] Hong Kong - DOH [5] Singapore - MOH [6] News brief    [A] China - Quinghai    [B] Taiwan/Japan traveler [A] Cumulative Number of Reported Probable Cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/2003_05_16/en/> From: 1 Nov 20021 To: 16 May 2003, 17:00 GMT+2 Country: Cumulative no.

CONTEXT: As SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may change over time.

CONTEXT: [C]  Update 57 - Situation in China, guidance for mass gatherings, stability of the SARS virus, more than 600 deaths globally  16 May 2003 <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_16/en/> China has today reported 39 new probable SARS cases and 4 new deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 5191 probable cases and 275 deaths.

CONTEXT: Beijing reported 28 probable SARS cases today, on the sixth consecutive day that the city has reported less than 50 probable SARS cases.

CONTEXT: WHO experts interpret the decrease in case numbers as encouraging, but have cautioned against concluding that the city's SARS cases were on a downward trend.

CONTEXT: WHO officials fear that patients with milder symptoms of SARS are being excluded as probable cases.

CONTEXT: "They fit the case definition but because they get better in a few days, they are not seen as probable cases," explained Dr Daniel Chin, leader of WHO's Beijing team of SARS experts.

CONTEXT: "Clinicians are making this decision because there's an assumption that SARS patients must be very sick.

CONTEXT: But there's a [wide] spectrum of severity for SARS."

CONTEXT: Clinicians were also basing their decision to exclude patients as probable SARS cases [solely on the patient's report of no] known previous contact with a SARS case -� a definition used in areas with few SARS cases.

CONTEXT: Given the relatively large number of SARS cases in Beijing, such a criterion cannot be used, Dr Chin said.

CONTEXT: Dr Chin said patients with milder SARS symptoms must be treated with all the same precautions.

CONTEXT: "It is still possible that they are not SARS cases, but without a reliable test, we can't confirm that," he said.

CONTEXT: A study of clinical progression in 75 SARS patients, published in today's Lancet by a Hong Kong laboratory in the WHO network, describes 3 clinical stages in patients from the Amoy Gardens cluster.

CONTEXT: Guidance for mass gatherings was issued by WHO yesterday in response to concern that persons travelling to large events from areas with local transmission of SARS might pose a risk to other attendees in the host country.

CONTEXT: The recommendations, which are issued as global guidance and are based on a risk-benefit analysis, are in line with WHO efforts to prevent the further international spread of SARS while also protecting the travelling public from unjustified restrictions.

CONTEXT: See Guidance for Mass Gatherings: hosting persons arriving from an area with recent local transmission of SARS [<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/guidelines/gatherings/en/>] The purpose of the recommendations is to help hosting governments and organizers of such events make decisions that protect domestic populations.

CONTEXT: Such decisions are left to the authority of individual countries based on their own assessment of the nature of the event, the potential for exposure of the general population should a case of SARS occur, and the capacity of the country's public health infrastructure to cope.

CONTEXT: Capacity includes pre-existing arrangements for surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation --� in other words, capacity for managing the situation should someone attending the event become ill with SARS.

CONTEXT: WHO has today published additional data on the stability of the SARS virus on different environmental surfaces.

CONTEXT: See: First data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus compiled by members of WHO laboratory network.

CONTEXT: [<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/survival_2003_05_04/en/index.html>] The data, which come from studies conducted by laboratories in the WHO network, indicate that the SARS virus in *sterilized* stool can survive for 36 hours on a plastered wall or a formica surface, for 72 hours on a plastic surface or stainless steel, and for 96 hours on a glass slide.

CONTEXT: As of today, a cumulative total of 7739 probable SARS cases and 611 deaths have been reported from 29 countries.

CONTEXT: There are a total of 275 deaths reported due to SARS, of which 4 were newly reported in the past 24 hours [one each in Beijing, Hebei, Shanghai & Tianjin.

CONTEXT: Taiwan SARS Case Update Date:15 May 2003 1.SARS Case Update  As of 9:00 AM 15 May 2003 Probable Cases:      264 Released from hospital 41 Deaths reported to WHO  34 Suspect Cases: 281 Released from hospital: 75 Total of probable, suspect, and uncertain cases: 1076 (152 of which have been released from hospitals.)

CONTEXT: As SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may change over time.

CONTEXT: [C]  Update 57 - Situation in China, guidance for mass gatherings, stability of the SARS virus, more than 600 deaths globally  16 May 2003 <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_16/en/> China has today reported 39 new probable SARS cases and 4 new deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 5191 probable cases and 275 deaths.

CONTEXT: Beijing reported 28 probable SARS cases today, on the sixth consecutive day that the city has reported less than 50 probable SARS cases.

CONTEXT: WHO experts interpret the decrease in case numbers as encouraging, but have cautioned against concluding that the city's SARS cases were on a downward trend.

CONTEXT: WHO officials fear that patients with milder symptoms of SARS are being excluded as probable cases.

CONTEXT: "They fit the case definition but because they get better in a few days, they are not seen as probable cases," explained Dr Daniel Chin, leader of WHO's Beijing team of SARS experts.

CONTEXT: "Clinicians are making this decision because there's an assumption that SARS patients must be very sick.

CONTEXT: But there's a [wide] spectrum of severity for SARS."

CONTEXT: Clinicians were also basing their decision to exclude patients as probable SARS cases [solely on the patient's report of no] known previous contact with a SARS case -� a definition used in areas with few SARS cases.

CONTEXT: Given the relatively large number of SARS cases in Beijing, such a criterion cannot be used, Dr Chin said.

CONTEXT: Dr Chin said patients with milder SARS symptoms must be treated with all the same precautions.

CONTEXT: "It is still possible that they are not SARS cases, but without a reliable test, we can't confirm that," he said.

CONTEXT: A study of clinical progression in 75 SARS patients, published in today's Lancet by a Hong Kong laboratory in the WHO network, describes 3 clinical stages in patients from the Amoy Gardens cluster.

CONTEXT: Guidance for mass gatherings was issued by WHO yesterday in response to concern that persons travelling to large events from areas with local transmission of SARS might pose a risk to other attendees in the host country.

CONTEXT: The recommendations, which are issued as global guidance and are based on a risk-benefit analysis, are in line with WHO efforts to prevent the further international spread of SARS while also protecting the travelling public from unjustified restrictions.

CONTEXT: See Guidance for Mass Gatherings: hosting persons arriving from an area with recent local transmission of SARS [<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/guidelines/gatherings/en/>] The purpose of the recommendations is to help hosting governments and organizers of such events make decisions that protect domestic populations.

CONTEXT: Such decisions are left to the authority of individual countries based on their own assessment of the nature of the event, the potential for exposure of the general population should a case of SARS occur, and the capacity of the country's public health infrastructure to cope.

CONTEXT: Capacity includes pre-existing arrangements for surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation --� in other words, capacity for managing the situation should someone attending the event become ill with SARS.

CONTEXT: WHO has today published additional data on the stability of the SARS virus on different environmental surfaces.

CONTEXT: See: First data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus compiled by members of WHO laboratory network.

CONTEXT: [<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/survival_2003_05_04/en/index.html>] The data, which come from studies conducted by laboratories in the WHO network, indicate that the SARS virus in *sterilized* stool can survive for 36 hours on a plastered wall or a formica surface, for 72 hours on a plastic surface or stainless steel, and for 96 hours on a glass slide.

CONTEXT: As of today, a cumulative total of 7739 probable SARS cases and 611 deaths have been reported from 29 countries.

CONTEXT: As SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may change over time.

CONTEXT: [C]  Update 57 - Situation in China, guidance for mass gatherings, stability of the SARS virus, more than 600 deaths globally  16 May 2003 <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_16/en/> China has today reported 39 new probable SARS cases and 4 new deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 5191 probable cases and 275 deaths.

CONTEXT: Beijing reported 28 probable SARS cases today, on the sixth consecutive day that the city has reported less than 50 probable SARS cases.

CONTEXT: WHO experts interpret the decrease in case numbers as encouraging, but have cautioned against concluding that the city's SARS cases were on a downward trend.

CONTEXT: WHO officials fear that patients with milder symptoms of SARS are being excluded as probable cases.

CONTEXT: "They fit the case definition but because they get better in a few days, they are not seen as probable cases," explained Dr Daniel Chin, leader of WHO's Beijing team of SARS experts.

CONTEXT: "Clinicians are making this decision because there's an assumption that SARS patients must be very sick.

CONTEXT: But there's a [wide] spectrum of severity for SARS."

CONTEXT: Clinicians were also basing their decision to exclude patients as probable SARS cases [solely on the patient's report of no] known previous contact with a SARS case -� a definition used in areas with few SARS cases.

CONTEXT: Given the relatively large number of SARS cases in Beijing, such a criterion cannot be used, Dr Chin said.

CONTEXT: Dr Chin said patients with milder SARS symptoms must be treated with all the same precautions.

CONTEXT: "It is still possible that they are not SARS cases, but without a reliable test, we can't confirm that," he said.

CONTEXT: A study of clinical progression in 75 SARS patients, published in today's Lancet by a Hong Kong laboratory in the WHO network, describes 3 clinical stages in patients from the Amoy Gardens cluster.

CONTEXT: Guidance for mass gatherings was issued by WHO yesterday in response to concern that persons travelling to large events from areas with local transmission of SARS might pose a risk to other attendees in the host country.

CONTEXT: The recommendations, which are issued as global guidance and are based on a risk-benefit analysis, are in line with WHO efforts to prevent the further international spread of SARS while also protecting the travelling public from unjustified restrictions.

CONTEXT: See Guidance for Mass Gatherings: hosting persons arriving from an area with recent local transmission of SARS [<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/guidelines/gatherings/en/>] The purpose of the recommendations is to help hosting governments and organizers of such events make decisions that protect domestic populations.

CONTEXT: Such decisions are left to the authority of individual countries based on their own assessment of the nature of the event, the potential for exposure of the general population should a case of SARS occur, and the capacity of the country's public health infrastructure to cope.

CONTEXT: Capacity includes pre-existing arrangements for surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation --� in other words, capacity for managing the situation should someone attending the event become ill with SARS.

CONTEXT: They include one healthcare worker from Prince of Wales Hospital and 2 who are other patients and contacts of patients with SARS.

CONTEXT: A total of 1171 patients have recovered from SARS and have been discharged from public hospitals.

CONTEXT: This brings the total number of deaths attributable to SARS to 238.

CONTEXT: The cumulative numbers of patients who have been admitted to public hospitals with SARS since 12 Mar 2003 are as follows: Cumulative no.

CONTEXT: In the 16 May SARS bulletin (can be accessed at: <http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm> there is a discussion on the 234 reported SARS related deaths.

CONTEXT: About 71 percent of the SARS-related deaths were in individuals with pre-existing medical illnesses, such as hypertension, heart diseases, diabetes mellitus, or stroke.

CONTEXT: The number of patients who have recovered from SARS is 157, with 19 patients still hospitalised, 7 in intensive care.

CONTEXT: As investigations are still in progress, the IMH cluster will continue to be managed as a SARS outbreak.

CONTEXT: **Discharged patients under home quarantine: 498 (including 20 patients discharged from IMH) Contacts under home quarantine: 305 (including 295 related to IMH cluster) Total under home quarantine: 803 *Quarantine cases refer to those who are required to stay at home for precautionary reasons as they may have had contact with a SARS patient.

CONTEXT: ** This is an added precautionary measure for discharged SARS patients as well as those with co-morbidities.

CONTEXT: There are no known cases of SARS so far in the TAR.

CONTEXT: [B] Taiwan/Japan travel from The Yomiuri Shimbun <http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/20030517wo31.htm> A doctor from Taiwan who returned to Taipei after a tour of western Japan this week is suspected of having the SARS virus, Taiwan health authorities said Friday.

CONTEXT: The doctor works at a hospital in Taiwan where SARS infection has been discovered, and he was treating SARS patients there.

CONTEXT: The Taiwan authorities are working to determine whether any passenger or crew member has been infected with the SARS virus.

CONTEXT: [As of 16 May 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 7739 probable cases of SARS with 611 deaths reported to WHO.

CONTEXT: In [1][C] Worldwide - WHO there is a very interesting discussion of possible misdiagnosis of milder presentations of SARS with the potential to increase transmission of the disease if infection control isolation procedures are not adhered to, especially in the hospital setting.

CONTEXT: On a similar line of reasoning, earlier on in this outbreak, this moderator speculated whether one outcome of the SARS outbreak would be that health care personnel would add respiratory protection as a routine precaution when evaluating febrile respiratory illnesses in patients.

CONTEXT: Given the severity of the illness associated with SARS, (and epidemic/pandemic influenza), the addition of respiratory precautions when evaluating febrile respiratory illness seems as logical as universal precautions does with respect to contact with bodily fluids.

CONTEXT: probable) case of SARS in a physician from Taiwan who became ill while touring in Japan.

CONTEXT: According to WHO guidelines issued yesterday -- seehttp://www.who.int/csr/sars/guidelines/gatherings/en/,if it is correct that the physician involved had been working in a hospital that was involved in SARS transmission in Taiwan, and therefore may have been in contact with SARS cases, the physician should not have left Taiwan for 10 days following possible exposure to suspected SARS patients ("A person who has been in close contact or thinks he or she has been in close contact with a person suspected of SARS over the last 10 days, should not leave his/her country and should contact the national health authorities of his /her country.

ANSWER: West Nile encephalitis
CONTEXT: "No Arkansas residents have been diagnosed with West Nile encephalitis this year; however, the identification of West Nile virus in a horse is a reminder that the virus is here and we all need to take precautions," Williams said.

ANSWER: West Nile virus
CONTEXT: "No Arkansas residents have been diagnosed with West Nile encephalitis this year; however, the identification of West Nile virus in a horse is a reminder that the virus is here and we all need to take precautions," Williams said.

CONTEXT: "Since the majority of human and veterinary West Nile virus cases occurred from June through September [in 2002], a positive horse case this early is a little surprising, but some other states have already seen positive horses, birds, and even mosquitoes.

CONTEXT: West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne infection that can cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord).

CONTEXT: Most people infected with diseases transmitted by mosquitoes -- including West Nile virus -- experience no symptoms or have only mild symptoms such as fever and headaches.

CONTEXT: The Arkansas Department of Health will begin surveillance for West Nile virus in dead blue jays and crows on Mon 19 May 2003.

ANSWER: mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE)
CONTEXT: 9 cattle herds in Alberta and Saskatchewan have been linked to a breeder cow infected with mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE), a federal food inspector said.

CONTEXT: The recent outbreak of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) has renewed calls to ban game farming, which has been hard-hit by chronic wasting disease (CWD) -- a close relative of BSE.

ANSWER: BSE
CONTEXT: 9 cattle herds in Alberta and Saskatchewan have been linked to a breeder cow infected with mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE), a federal food inspector said.

CONTEXT: The herd where the infected cow was found, at a farm near Wanham, Alberta, is now being slaughtered and tested for BSE.

CONTEXT: - Mod.JW] On Tuesday the federal agency and the Alberta government announced a single cow from a herd near Wanham in northwestern Alberta was infected with BSE, the first case reported in Canada in a decade.

CONTEXT: The confirmation of BSE came Tuesday.

CONTEXT: [Other reports indicate the animal had no clinical signs of BSE, but more likely pneumonia.

CONTEXT: Such behavior is a key identifier in BSE.

CONTEXT: Many farmers supplement the protein in their animal feed with parts from other animals, and it's believed that BSE has spread through that practice.

CONTEXT: "I don't think anybody screwed up in sending carcasses to renderers, but now that we are a BSE country this should be re-examined," said Dr.

CONTEXT: Lavigne said Canada has no plans to use the rapid tests for BSE that have been adopted in some European countries, although it's an alternative that must be considered.

CONTEXT: The recent outbreak of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) has renewed calls to ban game farming, which has been hard-hit by chronic wasting disease (CWD) -- a close relative of BSE.

CONTEXT: While CWD and BSE are both transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), mad cow disease can be transmitted to humans in the form of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD).

CONTEXT: The wildlife federation issued a press release late Tuesday -- the day the BSE story broke -- calling on the provincial government to ban the commercial farming of elk and deer.

CONTEXT: Pete Schlivert, president of the SWF, said the timing of the press release was a  "coincidence'' and denied the federation was attempting to capitalize on the BSE scare to pressure the government into banning game farming.

CONTEXT: But the federation quoted Dion Curry of the Centre for Studies in Agriculture Law and Environment (CSALE) at the University of Saskatchewan, who said BSE in cattle, CWD in elk and deer, scrapie in sheep, and CJD in humans  "are all closely related, prion-based diseases.

CONTEXT: Sinclair added the beef cattle industry will survive the BSE scare, but he's not sure about game farming surviving CWD.

CONTEXT: BSE cannot be passed by casual contact.

CONTEXT: There is no scientific link between CWD and BSE.

ANSWER: mad cow disease
CONTEXT: 9 cattle herds in Alberta and Saskatchewan have been linked to a breeder cow infected with mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE), a federal food inspector said.

CONTEXT: The northern Alberta cow infected with mad cow disease was stumbling and unable to stand before it was shipped off for slaughter, says the Farmer who owned the animal.

CONTEXT: The recent outbreak of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) has renewed calls to ban game farming, which has been hard-hit by chronic wasting disease (CWD) -- a close relative of BSE.

CONTEXT: While CWD and BSE are both transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), mad cow disease can be transmitted to humans in the form of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD).

CONTEXT: "It had no connection at all with mad cow disease,'' said Schlivert, adding the release was in response to a seminar held the previous week in Saskatoon, which also called for the elimination of game farming.

ANSWER: mad cow diseasechronic wasting disease (CWD)
ANSWER: CWD
CONTEXT: The recent outbreak of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) has renewed calls to ban game farming, which has been hard-hit by chronic wasting disease (CWD) -- a close relative of BSE.

CONTEXT: While CWD and BSE are both transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), mad cow disease can be transmitted to humans in the form of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD).

CONTEXT: There is no established link between CWD in elk and deer and CJD or any of its variants.

CONTEXT: But the federation quoted Dion Curry of the Centre for Studies in Agriculture Law and Environment (CSALE) at the University of Saskatchewan, who said BSE in cattle, CWD in elk and deer, scrapie in sheep, and CJD in humans  "are all closely related, prion-based diseases.

CONTEXT: Governments must deal carefully with an outbreak of CWD because of its close relationship to these other fatal diseases.'' CSALE recommended the elimination of game farming because of the potential threat to both animals and humans.

CONTEXT: Schlivert said the federation has been calling for a ban on game farming for more than 10 years because of fears of CWD passing from game farm animals to wild populations.

CONTEXT: "We recognize this (CWD) has a huge threat to wildlife, and a huge threat to the welfare of farmed animals."

CONTEXT: Sinclair added the beef cattle industry will survive the BSE scare, but he's not sure about game farming surviving CWD.

CONTEXT: While there are no reported cases of natural transmission of CWD to domestic livestock, studies are underway to determine whether CWD can cross the species barrier.

CONTEXT: The CFIA has slaughtered and tested more than 10 000 elk, deer, bison, and cattle for CWD and spent close to $100 million on compensation and other costs.

CONTEXT: At least one Saskatchewan cattle producer thinks CWD could have a huge impact on the beef industry.

CONTEXT: Ken McDade, a Leoville area cattle producer, says he has been warning government officials, university professors, and advocates of game farming for over 19 years that CWD could have devastating effects on the Canadian beef industry.

CONTEXT: "We sat in a meeting in Saskatoon to discuss CWD, and there were a lot of educated people there.

CONTEXT: I brought this up, that if CWD crossed the species barrier and if cattle got it, that it could put us out of business.

CONTEXT: There is no scientific link between CWD and BSE.

CONTEXT: There is no evidence that CWD can be transmitted to people consuming CWD-infected animals.
