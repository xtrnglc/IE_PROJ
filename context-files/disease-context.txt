CONTEXT: The cholera epidemic had started in the separatist island of Anjouan before spreading to Grand Comoro, within which lies the Comorian capital.

CONTEXT: There were no fresh figures on the cholera situation in Anjouan island, where on average 300 new cases were recorded per week before the island was blockaded 20 March to prevent the disease from spreading to other islands.

CONTEXT: <pollackmp@mindspring.com> Source: Xinhua News Agency [edited] At least 93 people have died from cholera and other forms of acute diarrhea since February in the Mozambican capital Maputo, said the city's health director Olivia Ferreira on Friday.

CONTEXT: Over the period, a total of 5749 cases of cholera and acute diarrhea had been notified in the capital city, she said.

CONTEXT: It seems that in most cases the causative organism was not the cholera vibrio, she said, citing that out of a sample of 300 people suffering from diarrhea, it was found that only 15 percent of them had the cholera vibrio.

CONTEXT: Ferreira urged Maputo residents to go to health unit as soon as they start suffering from diarrhea or fevers, since these could be the symptoms of cholera or malaria.

CONTEXT: Preslar  <dpreslar@fas.org> Source: <http://usinfo.state.gov/products/washfile/latest.shtml> SATELLITES USED TO HELP PREDICT DEADLY DISEASE OUTBREAKS  NASA is providing new insights from space that may help health officials predict outbreaks of deadly water-borne cholera, a bacterial infection of the small intestine that can be fatal to humans.

CONTEXT: Scientists have learned how to use satellites to track blooms of tiny floating plant and animal plankton that carry cholera bacteria by using satellite data on ocean temperatures, sea height and other climate variables.

CONTEXT: "These experiments fulfill our hypothesis that cholera is associated with environmental conditions," said Dr.

CONTEXT: She is presently on leave of absence from the University of Maryland, and is co-author of the cholera-tracking project paper.

CONTEXT: The authors found that rising sea temperatures and ocean height near the coast of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal from 1992 to 1995 often preceded sudden growth, or "blooms," of plankton and outbreaks of cholera.

CONTEXT: "When such a model for Bangladesh is extended to the global scale, it may serve as an early warning system, enabling effective deployment of resources to minimize or prevent cholera epidemics in cholera-endemic regions," according to Brad Lobitz, principal author of the paper and a contract scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center, located in California's Silicon Valley.

CONTEXT: The scientists correlated years of hospital cholera records from Bangladesh with sea temperature and ocean height data that came from a variety of satellites and surface observations.

CONTEXT: The seventh cholera pandemic began in 1961 and now affects six continents, according to the paper.

CONTEXT: Sea height is important because tides reach further inland to affect more people who may drink or bathe in brackish water carrying cholera.

CONTEXT: "In most years Bangladesh has two cholera outbreaks," Lobitz said.

CONTEXT: The authors discovered that the sea surface temperatures show an annual cycle similar to the cholera-case data.

CONTEXT: More information about the cholera-tracking project is on the Internet at:http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/health/projects/cholera/cholera.htmlThe researchers used data from three Earth-observing satellites in the study: a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration weather satellite, the SeaWiFS instrument aboard the SeaStar (OrbView-2) satellite, and the U.S.- French TOPEX/Poseidon oceanography satellite.

ANSWER: leaf rust
CONTEXT: Wheat leaf rust has appeared earlier than usual again in the northern plains this year.

CONTEXT: **********  Wheat leaf rust.

CONTEXT: During April and early May, leaf rust development was slowed throughout the central Great Plains because of moisture shortage, but with the return of moisture in the form of rain and dew in mid-May the leaf rust increase process was rejuvenated.

CONTEXT: During late May, traces of leaf rust were found in southeastern Nebraska winter wheat plots and fields.

CONTEXT: On May 30, traces of leaf rust were observed on the leaves of winter wheat cultivars in east central North Dakota plots.

ANSWER: _Rickettsia prowazekii_
CONTEXT: [Classical (epidemic) louse-borne typhus is caused by the intracellular  bacterium _Rickettsia prowazekii_.

ANSWER: typhus
CONTEXT: There is an outbreak of louse-borne classical typhus in North Kazakhstan  Region.

CONTEXT: A total of 18 cases of  typhus have been registered during the last 2 months.

CONTEXT: Classical typhus was  associated with the Civil War [of 1918-1920 in the former Soviet Union] and  the devastation of the first years of Soviet power.

CONTEXT: Yelena Koptyayeva, head  of the children's infectious disease department of the third hospital of  Petropavlovsk, said "We had only one louse- borne classical typhus case in  1997 and 7 cases in 1998-1999.

CONTEXT: At present, if we take into account the  activity of our lice from April to October, then this year we have  registered 44 [sick] people so far, but this [includes] louse-borne  classical [typhus] and louse bites with a localised reaction.

CONTEXT: The 18 children with the diagnosis of louse-borne classical typhus,  admitted to the infectious department of the third city hospital during the  past 2 months, originate mainly from the Kyzylzhar District [surrounding  Petropavlovsk].

CONTEXT: [Classical (epidemic) louse-borne typhus is caused by the intracellular  bacterium _Rickettsia prowazekii_.

CONTEXT: The vector is the body (clothes) louse  _Pediculus vestimenti_; typhus infection is not transmitted by either the  head louse or the crab louse.

CONTEXT: Classical typhus is  endemic or quasi-endemic in 54 coutries.

CONTEXT: Historically, outbreaks of  epidemic typhus are associated with war, famine and social deprivation.

CONTEXT: Although typhus was wide-spread throughout the Soviet Union and Europe in  the aftermath of the Second World War, it was rapidly contained and largely  eliminated from the Soviet Union by the mid-fifties.

CONTEXT: However, a non-sterile  immunity can develop after infection and recrudescent typhus (Brill-Zinsser  disease) can occur from months to years following initial infection.

CONTEXT: Outbreaks of typhus can occur if the index patient is louse-infested and in  contact with others lacking immunity.

CONTEXT: Typically, in the Soviet era schools were often the focal points of typhus  outbreaks.

CONTEXT: This report of epidemic  typhus in Kazakhstan is significant in view of the current expansion of  oil-related industry and increased opportunity for foreign travel.

CONTEXT: WHO Confirms First Outbreak Of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever In Uganda ---------------------------------------------------------------- .

ANSWER: haemorrhagic fever
CONTEXT: The World Health Organization (WHO), in conjunction with its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, is coordinating the international response to an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in Gulu District, northern Uganda.

CONTEXT: [Ebola haemorrhagic fever is one of the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind, causing death in 50-90% of cases.

CONTEXT: At least 63 people in northern Uganda in the past 2 weeks have contracted a viral haemorrhagic fever that has now been identified by health authorities as Ebola hemorrhagic fever.

ANSWER: Ebola virus
CONTEXT: [The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is a technical partnership of national and international institutions and smaller networks who mobilize and pool their resources so that outbreaks of potential international importance are detected, verified and responded to efficiently and effectively by the international community.] Laboratory testing carried out at the National Institute of Virology in South Africa indicates that the cause of the outbreak is Ebola virus.

CONTEXT: The Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or semen of infected persons.

CONTEXT: The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 in the western equatorial province of Sudan and in the nearby region of Yambuku, northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire.] The Ugandan Ministry of Health has established a National Task Force for he Control of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers, for managing the response to the epidemic.

CONTEXT: The National Institute of Virology in Johannesburg, South Africa, has confirmed by PCR test that Ebola virus is present in the current outbreak in Uganda.

CONTEXT: NAIROBI: Uganda's neighbors have moved swiftly to try to stem the spread of the deadly Ebola virus which has killed at least 33 people in the east African country in the past two weeks.

CONTEXT: [The positive identification of the etiological agent as Ebola virus makes a link with Zaire less likely, particularly in view of the serological data referred to by Professor Werner Slenczka in the previous post, which revealed a low frequency of antibody reacting with Ebola virus and an absence of antibody reacting with Marburg virus among the inhabitants of northern Uganda.

ANSWER: The Ebola virus
CONTEXT: The Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or semen of infected persons.

CONTEXT: *****  Date: 26 Feb 2001 Source: National Pig Association  Limited exemption to the suspension of Great Britain livestock movement (1.16pm, 25 Feb 2001)  The Ministry of Agriculture today (Sunday, 25 Feb 2001) announced limited exemptions to the 7-day total prohibition of livestock movements imposed to ensure the containment and eradication of FMD.

CONTEXT: ***** Date: 26 Feb 2001 Source: BBC  Outbreaks 8 and 9 were confirmed at an abattoir in Wiltshire (which had had taken the lamb from the Devon outbreak 7) and a second farm in Devon (under same ownership as case 7) Sheep with FMD signs were found at an abattoir at Gaerwen on the island of Anglesey, Wales.

CONTEXT: ***** Date: 26 Feb 2001 Source: National Pig Association  [edited] 25 000 animals exposed to foot and mouth at 3 marts (6.15pm, 26 Feb 2001)  After sheep dealer Willy Cleave of Burdon Farm, Highampton, Devon, got FMD on his farms in the West Country - probably as a result of a link with the Waugh brothers swill-feeding farm at East Heddon in Northumberland - and before the disease became apparent, he had dealings with Hexham, Longtown (Carlisle) and Northampton marts.

CONTEXT: This means 25 000 animals may have been exposed to FMD as they passed through the 3 markets.

CONTEXT: Veterinarians will check some 3000 British pigs on 20 farms in Lower Saxony for FMD.

CONTEXT: Carcass tests in Germany have not found FMD, so far.

CONTEXT: (5.30pm, Feb 26) Total number of outbreaks of FMD has risen to 12.

CONTEXT: The ban applies to cattle, pigs, sheep and goats, but not to horses, poultry, milk, cereal, vegetables or animal feed."]  I believe milk tankers were implicated in past outbreaks as a means of  spread of  FMD virus between farms.

CONTEXT: Air is displaced during the milk loading process and creates aerosols capable of being a source of spread of FMD virus through the dispersal of infected milk particles picked up from a previous infected dairy or dairies where the disease was incubating.

CONTEXT: [The FMD outbreak appears to be enlarging; sheep are now involved.

ANSWER: Sin Nombre virus
CONTEXT: As for the etiologic agent being Sin Nombre virus, I don't think so.

CONTEXT: That  virus has never been shown to occur in India (or even outside North  America) and the vertebrate host of Sin Nombre virus, the deer mouse,  _Peromyscus maniculatus_, does not occur in India.

CONTEXT: If medical personnel are leaving the area; the signs of  illness are not compatible with those associated with hantavirus  infections; Sin Nombre virus is being provisionally considered as the  etiologic agent; no agent has been clearly defined; cerebral malaria has  not been ruled out; and everyone has a different hypothesis, the situation  could not be worse: anarchic.

CONTEXT: [Sin Nombre virus is the virus without a name, so the diagnosis could have  an etymological basis at least.

ANSWER: FMD
CONTEXT: [From a previous post:"It seems to me that with the enormous increase in  movement of people and animals that takes place, the concept of controlling  FMD by the elaborate rituals to assure FMD-free countries is no longer  tenable or appropriate.

CONTEXT: I also draw to your attention the fact that FMD is spectacularly infectious  and particularly unpleasant.

CONTEXT: It should also be pointed out that  it is the first significant outbreak since 1967, and other countries have  been more successful in maintaining FMD-free status.

CONTEXT: It is  thus clear that maintaining FMD-free status is a reasonable, even sensible,  long-term technique.

CONTEXT: It has become clear that the UK has been importing significant animal  products from areas where FMD is known to be endemic.

CONTEXT: I think it is highly likely that very many  in the UK will demand the banning of animal products from countries where  FMD is endemic.

CONTEXT: The contrast between the continued long-term export of meat products from  countries where FMD is endemic and the immediate banning of all UK produce  almost world-wide after one or two cases has been noted.

CONTEXT: The banning (which  is already in place in many countries as I understand it) of importation of  animal products from countries where FMD is endemic would put further  pressure on these countries to eradicate the disease (possibly with outside  assistance).

CONTEXT: There can be little doubt that this would be beneficial to worldwide animal  health, animal welfare, and the economies of those countries suffering from  the ravages of FMD, many of whom have many small peasant farmers, to whom  FMD must be particularly devastating.

CONTEXT: As expected, I have received many messages which together underline the  complexity of the epidemiology and politics of foot-and-mouth disease  (FMD).

CONTEXT: The use of ring vaccination [i.e., vaccinating susceptible animals  surrounding the known infected focus, sort of a "cordon sanitaire"] in  conjunction with a slaughter policy successfully eradicated FMD from  Western Europe and most of [what was then colonial] Africa .

CONTEXT: As a  consequence, research on vaccines in the UK was downgraded because FMD was  no longer considered a threat.

CONTEXT: [Many of us know outstanding British FMD  scientists who became what is known as "redundant" and migrated to the US]  The US does not have an abiding interest in FMD.

CONTEXT: [The Brits might now consider calling it "Foot-in-Mouth disease]  The re-emergence of FMD is a consequence of the globalization of trade and  the cheap food policies adopted by European governments after WWII.

CONTEXT: At the recent International Congress of Virology held in Sydney, Fred Brown  and Marc van Regenmortel described a very promising development in FMDV  vaccine research.

CONTEXT: There is a widely used and effective vaccine for FMD.

CONTEXT: There are also  vaccines prepared from several different strains of FMD that could be used  to protect against the pan-Asia strain of FMDV.

CONTEXT: As far as I know, the UK  has never utilized vaccines to FMD, even in the 1967 outbreak.

CONTEXT: The reason  for this include: (1) in the past the vaccines had occasionally been shown  to be contaminated with live virus, so those vaccines themselves could  cause FMD (this has been largely controlled recently, and I am sure that  vaccines made by the large multi-nationals are completely safe); (2)  vaccinated animals may be difficult to distinguish serologically from  previously infected animals (eliminating serology as a method of  identifying infected animals); (3) while attempting to "emergency  vaccinate" animals, the vaccination teams can spread disease; (4) and (in  my opinion) most importantly, vaccinated animals may be come infected, and  show less severe signs of disease, despite shedding virus, thus prolonging  an outbreak by allowing infected animals to escape ready visual detection.

CONTEXT: It was on the Island of Reims, just outside  Greifswald, where Friedrich Loeffler and his associates did the first work  with FMD.

ANSWER: type 1 polioviruses
CONTEXT: Characterization of isolates from the 3 patients revealed type 1 polioviruses derived from Sabin vaccine strain type 1, with a 3% genetic sequence difference between Sabin 1 vaccine and vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) isolates.

ANSWER: vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) isolates
CONTEXT: Characterization of isolates from the 3 patients revealed type 1 polioviruses derived from Sabin vaccine strain type 1, with a 3% genetic sequence difference between Sabin 1 vaccine and vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) isolates.

ANSWER: cVDPV outbreaks
CONTEXT: Following cVDPV outbreaks in the Dominican Republic and Haiti (Hispaniola) during 2000--2001 (1), the global polio laboratory network implemented additional testing requirements for all polioviruses under investigation, prospectively and retrospectively.

ANSWER: all polioviruses
CONTEXT: Following cVDPV outbreaks in the Dominican Republic and Haiti (Hispaniola) during 2000--2001 (1), the global polio laboratory network implemented additional testing requirements for all polioviruses under investigation, prospectively and retrospectively.

ANSWER: cVDPVs
CONTEXT: Retrospective testing of 2000 vaccine-related isolates from AFP cases globally has revealed no additional cVDPVs, although testing results of other isolates in the laboratory network are pending.

CONTEXT: The cVDPVs from the Philippines were detected after the implementation of new testing requirements for prospective virus investigations.

CONTEXT: The cVDPVs from the Philippines were detected after the implementation of new testing requirements for prospective virus investigations.

CONTEXT: In response to these cases, the Department of Health in the Philippines 1) enhanced surveillance by active record review for AFP cases in hospitals and other health-care facilities in the affected and neighboring provinces, 2) established surveillance to conduct virologic investigations of aseptic meningitis at major health-care facilities, 3) collected stool samples from healthy contacts of case-patients, 4) conducted field investigations of clustered AFP cases to determine the extent of cVDPV circulation, and 5) assessed polio vaccination coverage in these communities.

CONTEXT: To interrupt cVDPV circulation, a large-scale mass vaccination campaign with OPV is planned.

CONTEXT: Low routine vaccination coverage is one of the most important causes of VDPV.

CONTEXT: Because the location of the originating events is unknown, the contribution of other factors is difficult to assess; however, a combination of 2 concurrent events within the virus is necessary for cVDPV emergence: reversion of attenuating mutations to increase neurovirulence, and a presumed increase in transmission characteristics that might be related to recombination with a nonpolio enterovirus.

CONTEXT: Among the areas covered were Cebu, Davao, Manila, and parts of Mindanao; however, coverage did not extend to the 3 provinces now reporting cVDPV cases.

CONTEXT: [This is now the third documented episode of poliomyelitis-like illness (acute flaccid paralysis - AFP) due to circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) with reversion to neurovirulence.

CONTEXT: The former seems to be preliminarily ruled out by the failure of a retrospective study of over 2000 AFP associated poliovirus isolates to identify additional VDPV, albeit if it is a low level occurrence, we may miss it by virtue of the rarity of the event.

CONTEXT: The occurrence of cVDPV in association with clinical disease is very disturbing as it adds another factor into the risk benefit equation of vaccination recommendations.

CONTEXT: The occurrence of cVDPV in association with clinical disease is very disturbing as it adds another factor into the risk benefit equation of vaccination recommendations.

ANSWER: cVDPV emergence
CONTEXT: Because the location of the originating events is unknown, the contribution of other factors is difficult to assess; however, a combination of 2 concurrent events within the virus is necessary for cVDPV emergence: reversion of attenuating mutations to increase neurovirulence, and a presumed increase in transmission characteristics that might be related to recombination with a nonpolio enterovirus.

CONTEXT: Public Health Dispatch: Acute Flaccid Paralysis Associated with Circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus --- Philippines, 2001 Three cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) isolates were reported in the Philippines during March 15--July 26, 2001.

CONTEXT: Following cVDPV outbreaks in the Dominican Republic and Haiti (Hispaniola) during 2000--2001 (1), the global polio laboratory network implemented additional testing requirements for all polioviruses under investigation, prospectively and retrospectively.

CONTEXT: Retrospective testing of 2000 vaccine-related isolates from AFP cases globally has revealed no additional cVDPVs, although testing results of other isolates in the laboratory network are pending.

CONTEXT: The cVDPVs from the Philippines were detected after the implementation of new testing requirements for prospective virus investigations.

CONTEXT: In response to these cases, the Department of Health in the Philippines 1) enhanced surveillance by active record review for AFP cases in hospitals and other health-care facilities in the affected and neighboring provinces, 2) established surveillance to conduct virologic investigations of aseptic meningitis at major health-care facilities, 3) collected stool samples from healthy contacts of case-patients, 4) conducted field investigations of clustered AFP cases to determine the extent of cVDPV circulation, and 5) assessed polio vaccination coverage in these communities.

CONTEXT: To interrupt cVDPV circulation, a large-scale mass vaccination campaign with OPV is planned.

CONTEXT: Because the location of the originating events is unknown, the contribution of other factors is difficult to assess; however, a combination of 2 concurrent events within the virus is necessary for cVDPV emergence: reversion of attenuating mutations to increase neurovirulence, and a presumed increase in transmission characteristics that might be related to recombination with a nonpolio enterovirus.

CONTEXT: Among the areas covered were Cebu, Davao, Manila, and parts of Mindanao; however, coverage did not extend to the 3 provinces now reporting cVDPV cases.

CONTEXT: [This is now the third documented episode of poliomyelitis-like illness (acute flaccid paralysis - AFP) due to circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) with reversion to neurovirulence.

CONTEXT: The occurrence of cVDPV in association with clinical disease is very disturbing as it adds another factor into the risk benefit equation of vaccination recommendations.

CONTEXT: Because the location of the originating events is unknown, the contribution of other factors is difficult to assess; however, a combination of 2 concurrent events within the virus is necessary for cVDPV emergence: reversion of attenuating mutations to increase neurovirulence, and a presumed increase in transmission characteristics that might be related to recombination with a nonpolio enterovirus.

CONTEXT: Among the areas covered were Cebu, Davao, Manila, and parts of Mindanao; however, coverage did not extend to the 3 provinces now reporting cVDPV cases.

CONTEXT: [This is now the third documented episode of poliomyelitis-like illness (acute flaccid paralysis - AFP) due to circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) with reversion to neurovirulence.

CONTEXT: The occurrence of cVDPV in association with clinical disease is very disturbing as it adds another factor into the risk benefit equation of vaccination recommendations.

ANSWER: anthrax
CONTEXT: Sent: Thu 20 Dec 2001 7:52 AM From: JoeParrish <JoeParrish@compuserve.com> Source: ENVIRONMENT NEWS SERVICE (ENS) [edited] <http://ens-news.com/ens/dec2001/2001L-12-19-06.html> WASHINGTON DC, 19 Dec 2001 (ENS): Members of congress and others who may  have been exposed to anthrax from contaminated letters will be offered a  controversial anthrax vaccine, the United States Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) said on Tuesday.

CONTEXT: Many of those who were exposed to anthrax spores are now finishing a 60 day  course of antibiotics.

CONTEXT: But some animal studies suggest that anthrax spores  could continue to survive within the lungs of exposed people, even after 60  days of antibiotic treatment.

CONTEXT: HHS is providing 2 additional options beyond  the 60 day course for those who may wish to pursue them: an extended course  of antibiotics, and experimental treatment with the anthrax vaccine.

CONTEXT: The  vaccine, developed for use by military personnel who could be exposed to  weapons-grade anthrax in the field, is only intended to protect people who  are immunized before exposure.

CONTEXT: In addition, the agency feels the chance of  anyone developing anthrax this long after exposure is very low.

CONTEXT: The HHS has paid the Department of Defense $598 000 for about 219 000 doses  of the anthrax vaccine, but expects to use fewer than 3000.

CONTEXT: People exposed to high doses may still have  potentially deadly anthrax spores in their lungs after taking the  recommended 60-day course of antibiotics.

CONTEXT: As many as 3000 people are at the  highest risk of having lingering spores and might be candidates for an  anthrax vaccine, officials said."

CONTEXT: The researchers found that the  acellular vaccine, which is very similar if not identical to the one in use  today, gave poor protection against most strains of anthrax except the  Vollum and Vollum 1B strains, against which protection was 100 per cent.

CONTEXT: It  gave no protection at all against the Ames strain, which is the same one  used for the recent anthrax attacks.

ANSWER: BSE
CONTEXT: Note on suspicion of a milk replacement as possible source of BSE, Denmark -------------------------------------------------------------------------- .

CONTEXT: Milk replacements: The Plant Directorate investigates possible sources of infections from feed  in all BSE positive cases in Denmark and has so far finished detailed  reports on the first 3 cases out of 7 in total.

CONTEXT: It appears from the report on the 3rd case that the only feed, which has  been used in all 3 BSE-positive herds, is the milk replacement "Sundkalv"  produced by the firm "Nordmilch EG", Germany, but that contamination with  meat and bone meal (MBM) in other feed products used in the herds cannot be  ruled out.

CONTEXT: At the  time of production of the batches of milk replacements that were used in  BSE infected herds, it was not obligatory to remove specified risk material  (SRM) in the slaughterhouses in all EU member states.

CONTEXT: Therefore there is a  risk that the product might have been contaminated with fat produced from  parts of spinal cord and brain from BSE positive cattle.

CONTEXT: Denmark's BSE reference laboratory, The Danish Veterinary Laboratory (DVL),  is currently conducting a risk evaluation on the use of animal fat as feed  for ruminants and the risk entailed using the milk replacements on the  market in Denmark.

CONTEXT: Furthermore, DVL is working on an epidemiological project regarding the  possible causal association of BSE and milk replacements.

CONTEXT: If the product in  question has been used by most of the Danish farmers, there is not  necessarily a causal relation between a case of BSE and the use of this  milk replacement on the farm.

CONTEXT: Furthermore reference is made to an article in Deutsche Tierarztliche  Wochenschrift, no 7 from Jul 2001 on feed ingredients, including fat, and  their potential role in the spread of BSE.

CONTEXT: From the reports on the first 3 BSE cases made by the Plant Directorate,  it appears that cross contamination with MBM cannot be ruled out as a  possible source of infection.

CONTEXT: Denmark has so far had 7 cases of BSE in cattle born in Denmark.

CONTEXT: Conclusions: The following possibilities for infection with BSE cannot be ruled out with  regard to the first 7 cases of BSE in Denmark: 1.

CONTEXT: [The appearance of BSE in Denmark, a country which officially banned the  import of MBMs since 1933, is of particular interest.

CONTEXT: According to the  Danish data <http://www.vfd.dk/java_enab/f_uk.html>, Denmark has carried  out 255 951 BSE tests from Jan to Nov 2001, including 17 836 in fallen  stock (2 positive); 1682 in emergency slaughtered bovines (all negative);  232 167 tests in healthy slaughtered bovines (3 BSE positive); and 12 tests  in clinically suspected cases (1 positive).

CONTEXT: The presented Danish notes, kindly forwarded to ProMED by the Danish  Veterinary and Food Administration, are valuable also for the assessment of  BSE cases in countries which have been regarded, until recently, to have a  low risk status and for the evaluation of possible BSE cases appearing in  additional countries of the same Geographic BSE Risk (GBR) status.

CONTEXT: Though  not (yet) conclusive, the Danish notes are highlighting again the  significant role which cross contamination in EU slaughterhouses has played  in the dissemination of BSE by means of infected feed, with special  emphasis upon the possible involvement of fat included in milk  replacements.

CONTEXT: The reader may recollect the Japanese publications,  circulated by ProMED on 12 Dec 2001, reporting that all 3 Holstein cows,  recently found BSE positive there, had consumed a milk replacement (in this  case -- according to the media -- the included animal fat was produced in  the Netherlands).

CONTEXT: Similar investigations in other countries which have been previously  regarded as belonging to GBR of "category II", namely where "BSE is  unlikely but it cannot be excluded that cattle is infected (clinical or  sub-clinical) with the BSE agent" are highly desirable.

CONTEXT: Such countries as  Finland and Austria might add missing links and enable reaching final  conclusions related to the potential role of milk replacements in the  recent, current, or potential future spread of BSE.

ANSWER: TSE
CONTEXT: ************************************************* A PrOMED-mail post <http://www.promedmail.org> ProMED-mail, a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases <http://www.isid.org> It is curious that the distribution of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) in Nebraska (NE) deer is in proximity to only one of 2 areas of TSE occurrence.

CONTEXT: It raises the question posed below: We understand that the available evidence from sheep, deer, and elk suggest at least 2 separate factors: genetics and some type of contact transmission (possibly even a low-level sexually transmitted disease-type prion 'infectivity') are necessary to explain the occurrence of TSE in these wild populations.

CONTEXT: Why is there no TSE (so far) in the wild herds in Sioux County?

CONTEXT: In these updates: [1], (2) Cuba [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] Brazil [8], [9] Malaysia Cuban President Fidel Castro said this week that 2 adults had died in the most recent outbreak of dengue -- a disease transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito -- prompting authorities to launch an intensive health campaign.

CONTEXT: Castro cited a Public Health Ministry report dated 29 Nov 2001 that counted 1601 dengue cases in Havana since the beginning of the year.

CONTEXT: It was on 3 Dec 2001 that he first made public reference to the dengue outbreak in the capital city, Castro noted.

CONTEXT: During the hemorrhagic dengue epidemic of 1981, as many as 11 400 new cases were reported in one day, he recalled.

CONTEXT: He did not say how many new dengue cases were reported since November 2001.

CONTEXT: But patients have to be treated to avoid complications, especially with hemorrhagic dengue, which occurs from repeated exposure to different strains of the virus.

CONTEXT: The last national dengue epidemic was in 1981, killing 158 people.

CONTEXT: - Mod.JW] An epidemic of dengue fever killed 5 people in Rio de Janeiro during the month of January, health officials said on Fri 1 Feb 2002, as a task force arrived in the city to combat the infected mosquitoes that spread the disease.

CONTEXT: The 5 people who died in January had dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).

CONTEXT: The death toll could still rise as several other deaths in recent days are suspected to be caused by dengue.

ANSWER: Eastern Equine Encephalopathy (EEE)
CONTEXT: Full results of the investigation into the first recorded case of  Eastern Equine Encephalopathy (EEE) in California are now available  at the above URL.

ANSWER: EEEV (Easter Equine Encephalitis Virus)
ANSWER: EEE
CONTEXT: Full results of the investigation into the first recorded case of  Eastern Equine Encephalopathy (EEE) in California are now available  at the above URL.

CONTEXT: The following is a portion of the conclusions: After we excluded disease by natural infection, bioterrorism, and  importation, incomplete formalin inactivation of the EEEV (Easter  Equine Encephalitis Virus) in the vaccine had to be considered a  likely possibility.

CONTEXT: Attempts to isolate live EEEV from residual and stored vaccine were  unsuccessful.

CONTEXT: Unfortunately, the North American  variety of EEEV  is the most genetically homologous of the  alphaviruses and therefore the least conducive to molecular  comparison of strains (9,22).

CONTEXT: Differences among sequences from Vaccine A EEEV and the horse viral  isolate in the  E1 region might represent mutations that occurred  when virus passed through various hosts (horse brain/BHK cell  culture/1) or genetic variants within the vaccine strain.

CONTEXT: However, we  concluded on the basis of the limited number of clones analyzed that  there were few to no other EEEV subclones in the horse viral isolate  or vaccine virus.

CONTEXT: Also, very few EEEV sequences that  included the nonstructural regions have been published in GenBank, so  comparison was limited.

CONTEXT: Regardless, the Vaccine A EEEV appears to be  closely related to the horse viral isolate; thus, the possibility  of  live virus in the formalin-treated vaccine infecting the horse  remains.
