CONTEXT: Denmark has so far had 7 cases of BSE in cattle born in Denmark.

CONTEXT: Conclusions: The following possibilities for infection with BSE cannot be ruled out with  regard to the first 7 cases of BSE in Denmark: 1.

ANSWER: cattle
CONTEXT: According to the producer  the products contain fat derived from bones from cattle and swine delivered  from slaughterhouses in several European Union (EU) member states.

CONTEXT: Therefore there is a  risk that the product might have been contaminated with fat produced from  parts of spinal cord and brain from BSE positive cattle.

CONTEXT: In addition to the feed bans there was a tightening, in Jan 1997, of the  regulations regarding production of mixed feed to cattle.

CONTEXT: These were  practical measures, which should prevent MBM -- for example, in swine feed  -- from contaminating cattle feed.

CONTEXT: Denmark has so far had 7 cases of BSE in cattle born in Denmark.

CONTEXT: Animal fat in feed for cattle -- for example, in milk replacements for  calves.

CONTEXT: Similar investigations in other countries which have been previously  regarded as belonging to GBR of "category II", namely where "BSE is  unlikely but it cannot be excluded that cattle is infected (clinical or  sub-clinical) with the BSE agent" are highly desirable.

CONTEXT: [There were 4161 cases and 277 deaths  reported to have occurred in the USA during 2002 as of data available on  the CDC WNV website current to 13 Mar 2003  <http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/wncount.htm> - Mod.MPP] The health authorities stated that a laboratory analysis conducted in the  United States last February [2003?], confirmed that some blood specimens  collected in November [2002?] from birds in the Los Haitises National Park  had specific antibodies against WNV.

CONTEXT: This finding demonstrates that WNV  has been transmitted locally to birds resident in the  country.

CONTEXT: A team from the University of Kansas of the  USA is due to arrive next week and will accompany the health authorities  from the Direction of Wild Life and Zoological Park, in the evaluation of a  model for epidemiologic surveillance [in humans and birds].

CONTEXT: The Dominican Republic receives approximately 18 species of migratory  birds.

CONTEXT: The director of CENCET presumes that WNV arrived [in the Dominican  Republic] with these migratory birds from other infected  countries.

CONTEXT: However, at the present time, there  have been no birds, mammals or human beings identified with illness  associated with WNV infection.

ANSWER: five
CONTEXT: These specimens were sent to the CDC  laboratory, and nine of the specimens collected were positive for  flaviviruses, and five of these were confirmed to have antibodies against  WNV.

ANSWER: SARS patients
CONTEXT: A coronavirus has been detected in samples obtained from SARS patients in Hanoi by Sylvie van der Werf and colleagues in the Molecular Genetics of Respiratory Viruses Unit at the Institut Pasteur.

CONTEXT: - Mod.CP] Detection of Novel Coronavirus and Human Metapneumovirus Sequences in the Same SARS Patients ------------------ [The following description of the virological investigations in Canadian SARS patients has been extracted from the paper by Poutanen et al., entitled "Identification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Canada" and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.

CONTEXT: It confirms previous statements from Canadian sources that a human metapneumovirus had been isolated from a SARS patient and further appears to indicate the presence of both a novel coronavirus and a human metapneumovirus in 4 of 5 virus-positive SARS patients.

CONTEXT: [Now that a lab test is widely available for the coronavirus that was isolated from 2 SARS patients in Germany, there may be a danger of circular reasoning about the etiology.

CONTEXT: One has to bear in mind -- or explain away -- all the conflicting findings, by multiple labs, of viruses from SARS patients that were not coronaviruses.

ANSWER: 6 patients

ANSWER: birds
CONTEXT: The  ProMED posting dated 10 May 2003, "Psittacosis, birds -  Australia (NSW)20030509.1157," had one significant misleading  fact and a few questionable elements.

CONTEXT: It is correct that *experimental* hosts of this disease can include all  species of birds; however, it is important to distinguish between  experimental disease transmission and natural occurrence of the  disease.

CONTEXT: I would therefore question the claim that "all birds are  susceptible to the infection."

CONTEXT: The response of different species of  birds is not uniform, and some are highly resistant to the disease.

CONTEXT: In some species of birds the disease has never been reported.

CONTEXT: Highly resistant species of birds  do not impose the same human  health risk, because they either do not shed the organism or  harbour only a small number of these bacteria.

ANSWER: the infected cow
CONTEXT: Claude Lavigne said additional farms could be placed under quarantine and that the focus is determining where the infected cow was bred.

CONTEXT: The suspected birthplace of the infected cow is a farm near Baldwinton, Sask., Lavigne said.

CONTEXT: The herd where the infected cow was found, at a farm near Wanham, Alberta, is now being slaughtered and tested for BSE.

CONTEXT: Officials are also trying to determine what the infected cow and the herds linked to it were fed.

CONTEXT: The news of the infected cow has huge implications for Canada's $30-billion beef industry.

CONTEXT: The 9 cattle herds -- 7 in Alberta and 2 in Saskatchewan -- were isolated because they once included the infected cow or its calves.

CONTEXT: The owner of one of the farms northwest of Saskatoon said he's not convinced the infected cow was born on his ranch.
