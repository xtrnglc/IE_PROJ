ANSWER: 7 cases
CONTEXT: Denmark has so far had 7 cases of BSE in cattle born in Denmark.

CONTEXT: Conclusions: The following possibilities for infection with BSE cannot be ruled out with  regard to the first 7 cases of BSE in Denmark: 1.

ANSWER: cattle
CONTEXT: According to the producer  the products contain fat derived from bones from cattle and swine delivered  from slaughterhouses in several European Union (EU) member states.

CONTEXT: Therefore there is a  risk that the product might have been contaminated with fat produced from  parts of spinal cord and brain from BSE positive cattle.

CONTEXT: In addition to the feed bans there was a tightening, in Jan 1997, of the  regulations regarding production of mixed feed to cattle.

CONTEXT: These were  practical measures, which should prevent MBM -- for example, in swine feed  -- from contaminating cattle feed.

CONTEXT: Denmark has so far had 7 cases of BSE in cattle born in Denmark.

CONTEXT: Animal fat in feed for cattle -- for example, in milk replacements for  calves.

CONTEXT: Similar investigations in other countries which have been previously  regarded as belonging to GBR of "category II", namely where "BSE is  unlikely but it cannot be excluded that cattle is infected (clinical or  sub-clinical) with the BSE agent" are highly desirable.
