ANSWER: TAIWAN
CONTEXT: Taiwan's feed consumption, likely to decline as liberalization pries open its meat market, will be hurt further if authorities fail to contain the foot-and-mouth (FMD) virus, traders and industry officials said on Monday.

CONTEXT: Taiwan on Friday reported a fresh outbreak of FMD in southern feedlots and destroyed 134 cattle.

CONTEXT: An executive in the private Taiwan Feed Industry Association said Taiwan's feed industry would shrink further if the virus spreads to other hoofed animals.

CONTEXT: Taiwan's feedlots were devastated in 1997 by an island-wide outbreak of FMD, forcing farmers to destroy a quarter of the island's 14 million hogs and destroying what had been a US$1.55 billion-a-year pork export industry.

CONTEXT: Taiwan's feed output, based entirely on imported grain, totaled 7.28 million tons in 1998 - well below the 8.4 million tons of 1997 and 9.24 million tons of 1996.

CONTEXT: Traders said Taiwan's market-opening moves, taken as part of its drive to enter the World Trade Organization, would erode feed consumption and thereby reduce demand for imports of feed ingredients - corn and soybeans.

CONTEXT: Although the cabinet's Council of Agriculture has ordered the destruction of any infected cows and vaccination of some 600 000 cloven-hoofed animals, traders said they worried the fresh outbreak could lead to a shortage in Taiwan's milk supply.

CONTEXT: Taiwan has about 160 000 cattle, of which 75 percent are milk cows.

ANSWER: DENMARK
CONTEXT: COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Portuguese authorities have uncovered a case of  so-called "mad cow" disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) in a  cow imported from Denmark, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration  said in a statement Wednesday.

CONTEXT: Although it could not be ruled out the cow had caught BSE before it left  Denmark, the case did not constitute a risk to Food safety there, said the  organization.

CONTEXT: The cow was born in Nordvestjylland, Denmark in March 1992  and was exported to Portugal in October 1994 from a herd of only 16, none  of which was still in Denmark.

CONTEXT: A number of countries immediately announced bans on Danish beef and Denmark  pulled beef products from its shelves.

CONTEXT: Denmark had previously been criticized by the European Union for  acting half-heartedly on recommendations to prevent BSE, with the  government proving unwilling to test dead or sick animals, or introduce new  methods in abattoirs.

CONTEXT: Until this year, Denmark believed its cattle were free from BSE, the only  previous case having occurred in 1992 -- an import from Scotland aroused  little domestic concern.

CONTEXT: Denmark has two million head of cattle.

ANSWER: PORTUGAL
CONTEXT: The cow was born in Nordvestjylland, Denmark in March 1992  and was exported to Portugal in October 1994 from a herd of only 16, none  of which was still in Denmark.

CONTEXT: While Portugal has reported 13 new cases of  BSE so far this year and registered 170 cases in 1999, the first case of  BSE in a native Danish cattle herd was announced in late February.

CONTEXT: WHO Confirms First Outbreak Of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever In Uganda ---------------------------------------------------------------- .

CONTEXT: The World Health Organization (WHO), in conjunction with its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, is coordinating the international response to an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in Gulu District, northern Uganda.

CONTEXT: These are the first cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever ever reported in Uganda.

CONTEXT: The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 in the western equatorial province of Sudan and in the nearby region of Yambuku, northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire.] The Ugandan Ministry of Health has established a National Task Force for he Control of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers, for managing the response to the epidemic.

CONTEXT: Epidemiologists from the WHO African Regional Office and the WHO office in Kampala, Uganda are already assisting with investigation and implementation of control measures.

CONTEXT: Drs Mike Ryan and Simon Mardel, epidemiologists from WHO headquarters in Geneva, will leave for Uganda today in order to provide further expertise in clinical management of cases and field investigation of the outbreak.

CONTEXT: "WHO and its partners will work with the Ugandan authorities to contain the disease in the outbreak zone and to reduce its spread in local communities," Dr Ryan said.

CONTEXT: The National Institute of Virology in Johannesburg, South Africa, has confirmed by PCR test that Ebola virus is present in the current outbreak in Uganda.

CONTEXT: NAIROBI: Uganda's neighbors have moved swiftly to try to stem the spread of the deadly Ebola virus which has killed at least 33 people in the east African country in the past two weeks.

CONTEXT: Kenyan health authorities have sent a medical team to Busia, the main border crossing point between Uganda and Kenya, to try to identify and isolate suspected Ebola cases.

CONTEXT: At least 63 people in northern Uganda in the past 2 weeks have contracted a viral haemorrhagic fever that has now been identified by health authorities as Ebola hemorrhagic fever.

CONTEXT: Given the proximity of the rich mining region of North Kivu and Haut Zaire to that area of Uganda, and the likelihood of frequent patrols by Ugandan troops, whatever strain of hemorrhagic fever the soldiers had possibly taken home with them could still be from contact with people who work those mines.

CONTEXT: My experience during the Rwandan civil disturbance of 1990 was that Ugandan troops were drinking along side Rwandese soldiers in the same bars in Gisenyi, Rwanda (near Goma, DRC).

CONTEXT: [The positive identification of the etiological agent as Ebola virus makes a link with Zaire less likely, particularly in view of the serological data referred to by Professor Werner Slenczka in the previous post, which revealed a low frequency of antibody reacting with Ebola virus and an absence of antibody reacting with Marburg virus among the inhabitants of northern Uganda.

CONTEXT: The Ugandan military deny that any soldier has contracted Ebola fever, contrary to previous reports and rumour.

CONTEXT: Increased Incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in Switzerland --------------------------------------------------------------- .

CONTEXT: In the 13 Jul 2002 issue of the Lancet, Markus Glatzel, Colette Rogivue,  Azra Ghani, Johannes R Streffer, Lorenz Amsler and Adriano Aguzzi  report  an increase in the incidence of [sporadic] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)  in Switzerland.

CONTEXT: The abstract of their research letter reads as follows: "  The incidence of CJD in Switzerland increased two-fold in 2001, and figures  from the first quarter of 2002 indicate that it continues to rise.

CONTEXT: In Switzerland, however, the incidence rate has  risen over the past 2 years and appears to be increasing.

CONTEXT: The rise in incidence of CJD in Switzerland over the past 2 years could be  a result of ascertainment bias; i.e., increased awareness of the disease  might have led to enhanced detection of CJD in patients who would have  otherwise been misdiagnosed.

CONTEXT: Furthermore, in Switzerland the mere  suspicion, rather than the diagnosis, of CJD became statutorily notifiable  in March, 1999.

CONTEXT: An ascertainment bias hypothesis would postulate that  the true average incidence of sporadic CJD is 3 or more per million per  year, indicating that all countries other than Switzerland are  under-reporting by more than 50% the number of CJD patients diagnosed every  year.

CONTEXT: Finally the authors consider the possibility that CJD in Switzerland is  related to a prion epizootic, and pay considerable attention to this  possibility since between 1995 and 1998, Switzerland reported a larger  incidence of BSE than did all other continental European countries (415  cases between 1990 and 2002).

CONTEXT: Scrapie is exceedingly rare in Switzerland: only  7 cases have been reported in the past 10 years.

CONTEXT: It remains to be seen whether this increase in the  incidence of CJD in Switzerland will be sustained, or whether it represent  a statistical anomaly.

CONTEXT: "There's no evidence at this time that the safety of Canada's beef has been compromised in any way.

CONTEXT: - Mod.JW] On Tuesday the federal agency and the Alberta government announced a single cow from a herd near Wanham in northwestern Alberta was infected with BSE, the first case reported in Canada in a decade.

CONTEXT: The news of the infected cow has huge implications for Canada's $30-billion beef industry.

CONTEXT: � Mod.TG] However, feeding protein from slaughtered cows to cattle does spread the disease, and the practice has been banned in Canada since 1997.

CONTEXT: [Given the ear tagging and tracking system that is mandatory in Canada, it seems strange that they do not know exactly how old the animal is.

CONTEXT: In Canada and the United States, it has been illegal to feed cow or sheep protein to other cows and sheep since 1997, and that ban was believed to have protected North American herds from the disease.

CONTEXT: Lavigne said Canada has no plans to use the rapid tests for BSE that have been adopted in some European countries, although it's an alternative that must be considered.
