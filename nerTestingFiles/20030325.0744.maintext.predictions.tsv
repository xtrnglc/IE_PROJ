: 0
We 0
are 0
now 0
10 0
days 0
into 0
an 0
outbreak 0
of 0
what 0
we 0
believe 0
is 0
a 0
previously 0
unrecognized 0
disease 0
in 0
humans 0
. 0
We 0
have 0
cases 0
that 0
have 0
spread 0
out 0
of 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
and 0
Viet 0
Nam 0
, 0
throughout 0
the 0
world 0
, 0
and 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
laboratory 0
group 0
which 0
has 0
identified 0
2 0
different 0
viruses 0
in 0
patient 0
specimens 0
. 0
a 0
paramyxovirus 0
and 0
a 0
coronavirus 0
. 0
At 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
, 0
we 0
ve 0
done 0
epidemiological 0
studies 0
which 0
, 0
to 0
date 0
, 0
have 0
shown 0
us 0
that 0
most 0
if 0
not 0
all 0
cases 1
can 0
be 0
identified 0
in 0
a 0
chain 0
of 0
transmission 0
from 0
the 0
patient 0
back 0
somehow 0
to 0
a 0
family 0
member 0
or 0
to 0
a 0
contact 0
directly 0
with 0
a 0
hospital 0
worker 0
or 0
with 0
a 0
hotel 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
. 0
As 0
of 0
now 0
we 0
still 0
maintain 0
that 0
travel 0
is 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
interrupted 0
throughout 0
the 0
world 0
. 0
But 0
as 0
you 0
know 0
there 0
s 0
much 0
, 0
much 0
information 0
coming 0
out 0
of 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
, 0
and 0
there 0
s 0
been 0
a 0
rapid 0
increase 0
in 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
cases 0
this 0
week 0
, 0
and 0
we 0
are 0
in 0
regular 0
contact 0
with 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
and 0
with 0
our 0
Regional 0
Office 0
in 0
Manila 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
be 0
reconsidering 0
today 0
our 0
travel 0
recommendations 0
as 0
we 0
do 0
every 0
day 0
. 0
Today 0
we 0
will 0
be 0
with 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
industrialized 0
countries 0
that 0
have 0
cases 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
countries 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
cases 1
are 0
occurring 0
in 0
Asia 0
. 0
So 0
we 0
re 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
a 0
10-day 0
period 0
which 0
has 0
seen 0
a 0
remarkable 0
working 0
together 0
of 0
scientists 0
, 0
epidemiologists 0
and 0
countries 0
in 0
the 0
world 0
to 0
better 0
understand 0
and 0
stop 0
the 0
spread 0
of 0
what 0
we 0
believe 0
is 0
a 0
previously 0
unrecognized 0
infectious 0
agent 0
. 0
Dr 0
Klaus 0
Stohr 0
: 0
8 0
days 0
ago 0
, 0
WHO 0
established 0
a 0
network 0
of 0
11 0
laboratories 0
in 0
9 0
countries 0
. 0
Now 0
8 0
days 0
later 0
, 0
these 0
11 0
laboratories 0
in 0
these 0
9 0
countries 0
have 0
found 0
already 0
2 0
very 0
strong 0
contenders 0
, 0
2 0
viruses 0
which 0
are 0
consistently 0
isolated 0
from 0
many 0
patients 0
from 0
very 0
many 0
different 0
countries 0
. 0
The 0
research 0
is 0
ongoing 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
not 0
normal 0
that 0
one 0
disease 0
is 0
caused 0
by 0
2 0
viruses 0
. 0
We 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
strengthen 0
the 0
activities 0
, 0
particularly 0
as 0
far 0
as 0
electron 0
microscopy 0
is 0
concerned 0
, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0

Dr 0
Julie 0
Hall 0
: 0
WHO 0
is 0
working 0
very 0
closely 0
with 0
all 0
its 0
partners 0
in 0
the 0
Global 0
Outbreak 0
Alert 0
and 0
Response 0
Network 0
. 0
We 0
ve 0
been 0
able 0
to 0
produce 0
guidance 0
based 0
on 0
clinical 0
and 0
epidemiological 0
evidence 0
posted 0
on 0
our 0
web 0
site 0
on 0
the 0
SARS 0
page.We 0
ve 0
established 0
a 0
logistic 0
basis 0
throughout 0
the 0
world 0
and 0
worked 0
in 0
close 0
collaboration 0
with 0
bilateral 0
arrangements 0
from 0
a 0
variety 0
of 0
different 0
countries 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
supplies 0
are 0
in 0
place 0
. 0
We 0
also 0
have 0
3 0
field 0
teams 0
in 0
place 0
. 0
In 0
Hanoi 0
there 0
are 0
9 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
there 0
since 0
14 0
Mar 0
2003 0
. 0
Their 0
key 0
focus 0
has 0
been 0
on 0
infection 0
control 0
and 0
where 0
infection 0
control 0
has 0
been 0
put 0
in 0
place 0
and 0
has 0
been 0
practised 0
effectively 0
, 0
we 0
have 0
seen 0
a 0
dramatic 0
reduction 0
in 0
inter-hospital 0
and 0
community 0
transfer 0
of 0
this 0
agent 0
. 0
They 0
have 0
also 0
been 0
working 0
hard 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
clinical 0
management 0
, 0
and 0
we 0
now 0
have 0
a 0
large 0
data 0
set 0
of 0
information 0
about 0
this 0
syndrome 0
which 0
will 0
help 0
us 0
to 0
understand 0
its 0
clinical 0
cause 0
and 0
possible 0
effective 0
treatments 0
. 0
It 0
s 0
been 0
shown 0
that 0
good 0
supportive 0
care 0
has 0
been 0
effective 0
, 0
and 0
we 0
are 0
now 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
in 0
Viet 0
Nam 0
where 0
, 0
now 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
developed 0
a 0
discharge 0
policy 0
, 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
patients 0
are 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
discharged 0
from 0
hospital 0
in 0
the 0
very 0
near 0
future 0
. 0
In 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
5-person 0
team 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
focusing 0
on 0
epidemiological 0
research 0
and 0
has 0
provided 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
data 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
how 0
this 0
infectious 0
agent 0
has 0
been 0
transferred 0
and 0
transmitted 0
between 0
people 0
and 0
what 0
infection 0
control 0
measures 0
are 0
required 0
. 0
A 0
5-person 0
team 0
arrived 0
on 0
Sunday 0
in 0
China 0
. 0
They 0
have 0
a 0
remit 0
-LSB- 0
permit 0
? 0
-RSB- 0
to 0
review 0
the 0
epidemiological 0
data 0
that 0
s 0
been 0
collected 0
by 0
the 0
Chinese 0
authorities 0
and 0
also 0
to 0
help 0
support 0
the 0
microbiology 0
and 0
virology 0
investigations 0
into 0
this 0
outbreak 0
. 0
So 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
an 0
unprecedented 0
collaborative 0
effort 0
, 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
institutions 0
that 0
are 0
working 0
in 0
the 0
various 0
forms 0
, 0
whether 0
it 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
field 0
teams 0
, 0
in 0
the 0
clinical 0
network 0
, 0
or 0
in 0
the 0
laboratory 0
network 0
; 0
the 0
details 0
of 0
all 0
of 0
those 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
sheets 0
at 0
the 0
back 0
if 0
people 0
want 0
to 0
look 0
at 0
those 0
. 0
When 0
I 0
look 0
at 0
the 0
latest 0
figures 0
from 0
the 0
WHO 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
really 0
worrying 0
because 0
it 0
seems 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
only 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
, 0
the 0
figures 0
kept 0
increasing 0
and 0
we 0
have 0
now 0
10 0
deaths 0
. 0
What 0
are 0
the 0
factors 0
that 0
make 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
so 0
special 0
? 0
It 0
seems 0
the 0
situation 0
is 0
not 0
under 0
control 0
. 0
A. 0
Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
Our 0
teams 0
are 0
also 0
concerned 0
about 0
the 0
situation 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
because 0
of 0
its 0
spread 0
in 0
many 0
different 0
hospitals 0
, 0
and 0
our 0
team 0
there 0
is 0
working 0
with 0
the 0
government 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
, 0
not 0
only 0
to 0
better 0
understand 0
what 0
s 0
going 0
on 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
as 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
epidemiology 0
or 0
the 0
transmission 0
of 0
the 0
disease 0
, 0
but 0
also 0
in 0
trying 0
to 0
stop 0
the 0
spread 0
of 0
the 0
disease 0
. 0
There 0
are 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
infection 0
control 0
experts 0
working 0
in 0
the 0
government 0
and 0
with 0
the 0
government 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
stop 0
this 0
outbreak 0
. 0
I 0
just 0
need 0
to 0
remind 0
you 0
though 0
that 0
at 0
present 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
evidence 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
any 0
transmission 0
other 0
than 0
close 0
contact 0
with 0
patients 0
, 0
either 0
sitting 0
next 0
to 0
patients 0
or 0
being 0
in 0
close 0
contact 0
with 0
patients 0
. 0
But 0
this 0
adds 0
to 0
the 0
urgency 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
this 0
remains 0
true 0
in 0
the 0
studies 0
that 0
are 0
found 0
because 0
now 0
, 0
as 0
you 0
know 0
, 0
there 0
are 0
cases 0
in 0
schools 0
, 0
there 0
are 0
cases 0
other 0
places 0
, 0
and 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
if 0
there 0
are 0
other 0
cases 2
in 0
schools 0
, 0
they 0
aren 0
t 0
cases 0
that 0
are 0
randomly 0
occurring 0
but 0
are 0
cases 0
which 0
sat 0
next 0
to 0
students 0
who 0
were 0
sick 0
. 0
And 0
the 0
same 0
goes 0
for 0
airplanes 0
, 0
if 0
there 0
are 0
airplanes 0
that 0
-LSB- 0
transported 0
-RSB- 0
someone 0
who 0
s 0
sick 0
, 0
we 0
would 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
sure 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
people 0
sitting 0
next 0
to 0
that 0
person 0
and 0
not 0
the 0
ventilation 0
system 0
in 0
the 0
aeroplane 0
which 0
was 0
spreading 0
the 0
disease 0
. 0
We 0
have 0
no 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
latter 0
right 0
now 0
, 0
but 0
this 0
is 0
why 0
studies 0
are 0
so 0
important 0
and 0
why 0
we 0
reinforced 0
our 0
team 0
to 0
work 0
with 0
the 0
very 0
excellent 0
teams 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
what 0
s 0
going 0
on 0
for 0
sure 0
. 0
A 0
couple 0
of 0
questions 0
. 0
I 0
assume 0
you 0
are 0
supportive 0
of 0
the 0
mass 0
quarantine 0
that 0
Singapore 0
authorities 0
have 0
announced 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
starting 0
today 0
. 0
Singapore 0
today 0
began 0
ordering 0
hundreds 0
of 0
people 0
to 0
stay 0
at 0
home 0
and 0
it 0
s 0
being 0
described 0
as 0
the 0
world 0
s 0
largest 0
quarantine 0
. 0
They 0
are 0
making 0
use 0
of 0
the 0
Infectious 0
Diseases 0
Act 0
, 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
they 0
ve 0
ever 0
used 0
it 0
. 0
So 0
-LRB- 0
a 0
-RRB- 0
are 0
you 0
in 0
favour 0
of 0
measures 0
like 0
that 0
? 0
and 0
-LRB- 0
b 0
-RRB- 0
my 0
second 0
question 0
is 0
, 0
when 0
you 0
were 0
talking 0
about 0
the 0
travel 0
advisory 0
, 0
you 0
seemed 0
to 0
stress 0
there 0
s 0
no 0
new 0
advice 0
for 0
the 0
present 0
. 0
But 0
are 0
you 0
expecting 0
this 0
might 0
change 0
after 0
the 0
meeting 0
with 0
industrialized 0
countries 0
today 0
? 0
A. 0
Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
The 0
first 0
is 0
that 0
WHO 0
puts 0
out 0
recommendations 0
on 0
travel 0
but 0
it 0
s 0
countries 0
who 0
make 0
the 0
final 0
decision 0
based 0
on 0
their 0
legislation 0
and 0
their 0
national 0
laws 0
. 0
That 0
s 0
why 0
we 0
re 0
meeting 0
with 0
countries 0
today 0
, 0
because 0
other 0
countries 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
concerns 0
as 0
Singapore 0
. 0
And 0
we 0
re 0
trying 0
to 0
work 0
with 0
them 0
to 0
better 0
understand 0
the 0
basis 0
for 0
their 0
concerns 0
. 0
The 0
recommendations 0
of 0
WHO 0
are 0
always 0
evidence-based 0
. 0
That 0
means 0
that 0
when 0
we 0
get 0
evidence 0
that 0
suggests 0
that 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
changing 0
a 0
policy 0
, 0
we 0
move 0
to 0
change 0
that 0
policy 0
. 0
We 0
ve 0
been 0
meeting 0
on 0
a 0
regular 0
basis 0
by 0
telephone 0
with 0
many 0
countries 0
. 0
Today 0
we 0
will 0
bring 0
all 0
those 0
countries 0
together 0
to 0
discuss 0
travel 0
recommendations 0
. 0
And 0
I 0
will 0
say 0
what 0
I 0
would 0
say 0
every 0
day 0
, 0
that 0
we 0
leave 0
it 0
open 0
that 0
if 0
there 0
is 0
new 0
evidence 0
with 0
which 0
we 0
can 0
make 0
a 0
better 0
policy 0
or 0
a 0
different 0
policy 0
, 0
we 0
will 0
do 0
that 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
not 0
hesitate 0
to 0
do 0
it 0
. 0
So 0
, 0
our 0
recommendations 0
will 0
be 0
evidence-based 0
and 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
make 0
a 0
recommendation 0
if 0
there 0
s 0
no 0
evidence 0
to 0
support 0
that 0
. 0
This 0
many 0
times 0
occurs 0
in 0
national 0
contexts 0
because 0
there 0
are 0
rules 0
or 0
laws 0
which 0
require 0
them 0
to 0
judge 0
on 0
the 0
side 0
of 0
safety 0
rather 0
than 0
on 0
the 0
side 0
of 0
non-safety 0
, 0
if 0
you 0
understand 0
what 0
I 0
m 0
saying 0
. 0
So 0
, 0
yes 0
there 0
s 0
always 0
a 0
chance 0
that 0
WHO 0
will 0
change 0
its 0
recommendations 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
keep 0
you 0
posted 0
if 0
that 0
should 0
occur 0
. 0
Q. 0
With 0
Singapore 0
, 0
I 0
presume 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
in 0
favour 0
of 0
measures 0
taken 0
, 0
such 0
as 0
those 0
in 0
Singapore 0
mass 0
quarantine 0
? 0
A. 0
Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
Governments 0
take 0
a 0
decision 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
conditions 0
locally 0
. 0
If 0
for 0
some 0
reason 0
Singapore 0
feels 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
trace 0
all 0
cases 0
because 0
there 0
s 0
such 0
great 0
mobility 0
in 0
their 0
populations 0
that 0
they 0
must 0
make 0
restrictions 0
on 0
them 0
, 0
then 0
that 0
s 0
what 0
they 0
ve 0
decided 0
to 0
do 0
. 0
Our 0
recommendation 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
be 0
no 0
restrictions 0
at 0
present 0
. 0
But 0
that 0
s 0
a 0
global 0
recommendation 0
. 0
And 0
again 0
, 0
that 0
s 0
being 0
reconsidered 0
on 0
a 0
daily 0
basis 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
re-considered 0
today 0
at 0
2.30 0
pm 0
in 0
our 0
conference 0
call 0
. 0
The 0
question 0
about 0
the 0
2 0
viruses 0
having 0
been 0
, 0
or 0
2 0
families 0
of 0
viruses 0
having 0
been 0
associated 0
with 0
this 0
disease 0
or 0
with 0
this 0
outbreak 0
. 0
You 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
normal 0
, 0
if 0
I 0
m 0
not 0
mistaken 0
. 0
Could 0
you 0
give 0
us 0
an 0
idea 0
of 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
it 0
s 0
possible 0
for 0
a 0
single 0
disease 0
to 0
be 0
caused 0
by 0
2 0
viruses 0
or 0
is 0
it 0
more 0
likely 0
that 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
samples 0
might 0
not 0
be 0
related 0
to 0
SARS 0
? 0
A. 0
Dr 0
Klaus 0
Stohr 0
: 0
Speaking 0
as 0
a 0
scientist 0
, 0
we 0
are 0
looking 0
at 0
a 0
very 0
interesting 0
and 0
a 0
fascinating 0
situation 0
. 0
Looking 0
from 0
the 0
point 0
of 0
infectious 0
disease 0
control 0
, 0
we 0
are 0
a 0
bit 0
puzzled 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
not 0
only 0
dealing 0
apparently 0
with 0
one 0
pathogen 0
but 0
with 0
2 0
. 0
The 0
reason 0
why 0
we 0
believe 0
that 0
both 0
pathogens 0
should 0
be 0
given 0
equal 0
attention 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
consistent 0
finding 0
of 0
both 0
pathogens 0
in 0
individual 0
patients 0
or 0
of 0
either 0
of 0
the 0
pathogens 0
in 0
other 0
patients 0
. 0
What 0
we 0
are 0
seeing 0
actually 0
are 0
3 0
hypotheses 0
. 0
The 0
first 0
hypothesis 0
is 0
that 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
viruses 0
, 0
for 0
instance 0
the 0
corona 0
virus 0
, 0
causes 0
the 0
disease 0
, 0
and 0
that 0
might 0
be 0
a 0
new 0
corona 0
virus 0
. 0
The 0
second 0
hypothesis 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
paramyxoviruses 0
cause 0
the 0
disease 0
and 0
if 0
that 0
was 0
the 0
case 0
, 0
it 0
s 0
certainly 0
also 0
a 0
new 0
paramyxovirus 0
. 0
The 0
third 0
hypothesis 0
, 0
very 0
obviously 0
, 0
is 0
that 0
these 0
2 0
pathogens 0
have 0
to 0
come 0
together 0
to 0
cause 0
this 0
very 0
severe 0
outbreak 0
. 0
One 0
of 0
the 0
viruses 0
, 0
for 0
instance 0
the 0
coronavirus 0
, 0
is 0
known 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
immune 0
cells 0
, 0
cells 0
which 0
are 0
important 0
for 0
defense 0
against 0
infection 3
. 0
So 0
what 0
one 0
could 0
hypothesize 0
is 0
that 0
this 0
coronavirus 0
destroys 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
diminishes 0
the 0
immunity 0
in 0
the 0
patient 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
second 0
virus 3
has 0
practically 0
an 0
open 0
door 0
to 0
go 0
in 0
and 0
to 0
sicken 0
the 0
patient 0
beyond 0
what 0
this 0
virus 0
would 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
do 0
normally 0
. 0
Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
Let 0
me 0
just 0
add 0
to 0
that 0
: 0
there 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
fourth 0
hypothesis 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
possible 0
that 0
both 0
are 0
common 0
viruses 0
: 0
one 0
found 0
in 0
all 0
the 0
patients 0
, 0
even 0
though 0
it 0
's 0
not 0
causing 0
disease 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
will 0
be 0
the 0
disease-causing 0
agent 0
, 0
so 0
they 0
could 0
both 0
be 0
found 0
but 0
not 0
be 0
related 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
, 0
just 0
there 0
by 0
chance 0
. 0
So 0
it 0
's 0
a 0
very 0
complicated 0
issue 0
that 0
's 0
being 0
sorted 0
out 0
. 0
In 0
China 0
, 0
is 0
the 0
team 0
in 0
Beijing 0
getting 0
new 0
figures 0
on 0
how 0
many 0
cases 0
we 0
have 0
in 0
China 0
? 0
Also 0
, 0
can 0
they 0
go 0
to 0
Guangdong 0
or 0
will 0
they 0
just 0
remain 0
in 0
Beijing 0
doing 0
that 0
kind 0
of 0
laboratory 0
service 0
? 0
A. 0
Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
Yesterday 0
the 0
team 0
in 0
China 0
had 0
a 0
question 0
from 0
the 0
Government 0
, 0
and 0
that 0
was 0
`` 0
why 0
is 0
WHO 0
not 0
putting 0
on 0
its 0
web 0
site 0
the 0
305 0
cases 0
that 0
we 0
reported 0
? 0
'' 0
The 0
answer 0
was 0
because 0
we 0
only 0
started 0
recording 0
cases 0
from 0
1 0
Feb 0
2003 0
, 0
and 0
we 0
do 0
n't 0
know 0
how 0
many 0
cases 0
China 0
had 0
from 0
1 0
Feb 0
2003 0
on 0
. 0
That 0
made 0
the 0
Chinese 0
believe 0
that 0
they 0
needed 0
to 0
go 0
back 0
and 0
look 0
at 0
their 0
data 0
, 0
and 0
they 0
've 0
promised 0
us 0
they 0
would 0
do 0
that 0
and 0
give 0
us 0
more 0
information 0
. 0
Today 0
that 0
information 0
has 0
not 0
come 0
out 0
yet 0
. 0
Our 0
team 0
has 0
met 0
with 0
officials 0
from 0
Guangdong 0
and 0
from 0
Beijing 0
but 0
the 0
information 0
is 0
not 0
yet 0
available 0
, 0
but 0
we 0
have 0
reason 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
it 0
will 0
be 0
made 0
available 0
and 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
very 0
much 0
interest 0
in 0
Beijing 0
by 0
the 0
international 0
press 0
on 0
these 0
issues 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
by 0
the 0
press 0
from 0
outside 0
Beijing 0
. 0
Q. 0
Is 0
the 0
team 0
going 0
to 0
Guangdong 0
? 0
A.Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
The 0
team 0
has 0
not 0
yet 0
been 0
invited 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
Guangdong 0
and 0
we 0
do 0
n't 0
know 0
whether 0
that 0
invitation 0
will 0
be 0
coming 0
. 0
Certainly 0
our 0
wish 0
would 0
be 0
that 0
the 0
Government 0
will 0
permit 0
us 0
to 0
work 0
with 0
them 0
in 0
all 0
aspects 0
of 0
this 0
outbreak 0
. 0
Q. 0
Do 0
you 0
think 0
it 0
's 0
advisable 0
for 0
the 0
team 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
Guangdong 0
to 0
help 0
investigate 0
what 0
's 0
going 0
on 0
? 0
Did 0
WHO 0
request 0
specifically 0
that 0
they 0
should 0
go 0
to 0
Guangdong 0
? 0
A. 0
Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
WHO 0
has 0
requested 0
the 0
Government 0
to 0
let 0
the 0
team 0
work 0
with 0
them 0
as 0
best 0
it 0
possibly 0
can 0
, 0
and 0
we 0
would 0
hope 0
that 0
that 0
would 0
include 0
working 0
in 0
Guangdong 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
working 0
in 0
Beijing 0
. 0
Q. 0
I 0
have 0
2 0
questions 0
. 0
My 0
first 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
hypothesising 0
about 0
the 0
first 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
outbreak 0
, 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
media 0
reported 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
Chinese 0
businessman 0
who 0
came 0
back 0
from 0
China 0
who 0
went 0
to 0
Hanoi 0
who 0
was 0
the 0
one 0
who 0
was 0
dead 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
. 0
Do 0
you 0
have 0
any 0
information 0
about 0
the 0
first 0
case 0
? 0
Secondly 0
, 0
can 0
you 0
clarify 0
the 0
route 0
of 0
transmission 0
. 0
Is 0
it 0
possible 0
to 0
have 0
transmission 0
by 0
air 0
? 0
A. 0
Dr 0
Julie 0
Hall 0
: 0
We 0
have 0
quite 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
information 0
about 0
the 0
gentleman 0
, 0
what 0
we 0
are 0
calling 0
the 0
`` 0
Hanoi 0
index 0
case 0
'' 0
, 0
the 0
Chinese-American 0
businessman 0
who 0
went 0
to 0
Hanoi 0
, 0
became 0
unwell 0
, 0
and 0
was 0
then 0
transferred 0
to 0
hospital 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
. 0
He 0
was 0
transferred 0
in 0
isolation 0
and 0
treated 0
in 0
isolation 0
as 0
well 0
once 0
he 0
got 0
to 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
. 0
The 0
team 0
in 0
Hanoi 0
are 0
currently 0
following 0
up 0
his 0
travels 0
prior 0
to 0
arriving 0
in 0
Hanoi 0
. 0
It 0
seems 0
that 0
he 0
travelled 0
quite 0
extensively 0
prior 0
to 0
becoming 0
unwell 0
and 0
prior 0
to 0
arrival 0
in 0
Viet 0
Nam 0
. 0
Further 0
details 0
on 0
that 0
are 0
currently 0
being 0
sought 0
by 0
our 0
team 0
so 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
follow 0
his 0
travels 0
in 0
the 0
2-3 0
weeks 0
prior 0
to 0
his 0
becoming 0
unwell 0
in 0
a 0
little 0
more 0
detail 0
. 0
Obviously 0
, 0
when 0
somebody 0
becomes 0
unwell 0
in 0
one 0
country 0
, 0
lives 0
in 0
another 0
country 0
, 0
and 0
is 0
then 0
transferred 0
for 0
care 0
in 0
a 0
third 0
country 0
, 0
it 0
does 0
take 0
a 0
while 0
for 0
all 0
this 0
detailed 0
information 0
to 0
be 0
put 0
together 0
. 0
Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
To 0
date 0
, 0
in 0
looking 0
at 0
every 0
case 0
that 0
occurs 0
, 0
it 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
possible 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
not 0
close 0
contact 0
with 0
another 0
patient 0
, 0
be 0
it 0
a 0
family 0
member 0
of 0
a 0
hospital 0
worker 0
, 0
a 0
hospital 0
worker 0
, 0
or 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
initial 0
cases 0
. 0
Now 0
that 0
information 0
comes 0
in 0
on 0
a 0
daily 0
basis 0
. 0
If 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
minute 0
we 0
find 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
cases 0
which 0
can 0
not 0
be 0
traced 0
to 0
close 0
contact 0
with 0
another 0
patient 0
or 0
another 0
person 0
at 0
risk 0
, 0
we 0
will 0
then 0
be 0
very 0
concerned 0
that 0
this 0
might 0
have 0
become 0
airborne 0
. 0
Airborne 0
meaning 0
that 0
you 0
would 0
be 0
at 0
risk 0
sitting 0
where 0
you 0
are 0
. 0
The 0
way 0
it 0
is 0
today 0
that 0
we 0
believe 0
from 0
the 0
evidence 0
we 0
have 0
, 0
the 0
only 0
person 0
at 0
risk 0
in 0
this 0
room 0
would 0
be 0
Dr 0
Stohr 0
, 0
who 0
's 0
sitting 0
next 0
to 0
me 0
. 0
But 0
if 0
we 0
find 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
at 0
risk 0
, 0
we 0
will 0
immediately 0
have 0
to 0
consider 0
a 0
whole 0
series 0
of 0
new 0
measures 0
to 0
recommend 0
and 0
the 0
studies 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
intensify 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
how 0
it 0
's 0
circulating 0
more 0
widely 0
than 0
just 0
by 0
person-to-person 0
contact 0
. 0
Q. 0
From 0
what 0
I 0
understand 0
from 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
last 0
week 0
, 0
you 0
were 0
becoming 0
more 0
confident 0
that 0
you 0
had 0
this 0
under 0
control 0
. 0
But 0
the 0
data 0
this 0
week 0
seems 0
to 0
show 0
the 0
opposite 0
. 0
How 0
confident 0
are 0
you 0
that 0
you 0
've 0
got 0
it 0
under 0
control 0
? 0
How 0
concerned 0
are 0
you 0
that 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
getting 0
worse 0
instead 0
of 0
better 0
? 0
A. 0
Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
When 0
we 0
made 0
the 0
global 0
alert 0
10 0
days 0
ago 0
, 0
our 0
goal 0
was 0
to 0
stop 0
outbreaks 0
occurring 0
in 0
other 0
countries 0
than 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
and 0
Viet 0
Nam 0
because 0
of 0
imported 0
cases 0
. 0
We 0
knew 0
that 0
Canada 0
had 0
had 0
imported 0
cases 0
and 0
had 0
had 0
local 0
transmission 0
within 0
Canada 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
look 0
at 0
the 0
global 0
alert 0
, 0
it 0
has 0
brought 0
in 0
reports 0
of 0
disease 0
from 0
many 0
different 0
countries 0
- 0
13 0
I 0
believe 0
is 0
the 0
latest 0
count 0
- 0
and 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
no 0
additional 0
outbreaks 0
in 0
those 0
countries 0
. 0
So 0
the 0
global 0
containment 0
exercise 0
has 0
been 0
successful 0
to 0
date 0
. 0
The 0
exercise 0
of 0
containing 0
the 0
disease 0
in 0
Viet 0
Nam 0
appears 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
successful 0
, 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
slowdown 0
in 0
new 0
cases 0
, 0
hospital 0
infection 0
control 0
has 0
been 0
strengthened 0
in 0
hospitals 0
, 0
and 0
it 0
appears 0
that 0
that 0
outbreak 0
has 0
been 0
contained 0
in 0
Viet 0
Nam 0
. 0
In 0
Singapore 0
, 0
where 0
there 0
were 0
imported 0
cases 0
, 0
there 0
appears 0
to 0
now 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
closing 0
in 0
on 0
contacts 0
of 0
patients 0
, 0
and 0
we 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
situation 0
in 0
Singapore 0
is 0
being 0
controlled 0
. 0
In 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
difficult 0
situation 0
and 0
a 0
different 0
situation 0
in 0
that 0
10 0
hospitals 0
are 0
now 0
involved 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
important 0
exercise 0
to 0
contain 0
the 0
disease 0
in 0
these 0
10 0
hospitals 0
. 0
We 0
also 0
know 0
that 0
people 0
have 0
been 0
in 0
schools 0
who 0
have 0
become 0
sick 0
, 0
so 0
there 0
is 0
where 0
the 0
efforts 0
must 0
be 0
now 0
intensified 0
in 0
addition 0
to 0
better 0
understanding 0
what 0
is 0
going 0
on 0
in 0
China 0
. 0
So 0
we 0
have 0
2 0
countries 0
in 0
which 0
we 0
are 0
very 0
concerned 0
now 0
-- 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
-- 0
and 0
in 0
finding 0
out 0
more 0
about 0
what 0
is 0
going 0
on 0
in 0
China 0
, 0
because 0
those 0
are 0
the 0
2 0
countries 0
where 0
we 0
have 0
less 0
information 0
and 0
we 0
are 0
less 0
sure 0
that 0
containment 0
activities 0
are 0
being 0
successful 0

Q. 0
For 0
the 0
incubation 0
period 0
of 0
the 0
disease 0
, 0
WHO 0
said 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
2-5 0
days 0
or 0
2-7 0
days 0
. 0
In 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
, 0
however 0
, 0
the 0
doctor 0
was 0
in 0
close 0
contact 0
with 0
the 0
patient 0
11 0
or 0
12 0
days 0
before 0
. 0
So 0
people 0
are 0
now 0
concerned 0
whether 0
we 0
should 0
play 0
safe 0
and 0
extend 0
the 0
incubation 0
period 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
virus 4
wo 0
n't 0
spread 0
even 0
further 0
. 0
Do 0
you 0
have 0
any 0
information 0
and 0
recommendation 0
on 0
this 0
? 0
A. 0
Dr 0
Klaus 0
Stohr 0
: 0
Thank 0
you 0
. 0
The 0
incubation 0
period 0
is 0
the 0
period 0
between 0
the 0
infection 0
, 0
when 0
the 0
patient 0
gets 0
in 0
contact 0
possibly 0
with 0
the 0
pathogen 0
, 0
and 0
when 0
the 0
first 0
clinical 0
signs 0
occur 0
. 0
Now 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
important 0
period 0
of 0
time 0
because 0
it 0
tells 0
us 0
presumably 0
that 0
during 0
this 0
period 0
of 0
time 0
the 0
person 0
can 0
start 0
spreading 0
the 0
virus 0
. 0
The 0
incubation 0
period 0
in 0
Hanoi 0
, 0
from 0
the 0
data 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
collected 0
during 0
the 0
first 0
two 0
weeks 0
of 0
the 0
outbreak 0
, 0
the 0
average 0
incubation 0
period 0
is 0
4.5 0
days 0
. 0
The 0
minimum 0
incubation 0
period 0
is 0
2 0
days 0
. 0
The 0
maximum 0
incubation 0
period 0
is 0
7 0
days 0
. 0
Very 0
similar 0
data 0
were 0
forthcoming 0
from 0
Singapore 0
, 0
with 0
a 0
minimum 0
2 0
days 0
, 0
maximum 0
7 0
days 0
. 0
We 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
a 0
biological 0
phenomenon 0
and 0
we 0
can 0
not 0
rule 0
out 0
that 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
slightly 0
shorter 0
or 0
slightly 0
longer 0
incubation 0
periods 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
we 0
have 0
also 0
to 0
realize 0
that 0
not 0
every 0
contact 0
of 0
a 0
doctor 0
with 0
a 0
patient 0
must 0
necessarily 0
lead 0
to 0
an 0
infection 0
, 0
so 0
even 0
if 0
there 0
has 0
already 0
been 0
contact 0
between 0
the 0
doctor 0
and 0
the 0
patient 0
over 0
a 0
period 0
of 0
time 0
, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
infection 0
took 0
only 0
place 0
4 0
or 0
5 0
days 0
after 0
the 0
contact 0
began 0
and 0
the 0
doctor 0
started 0
incubating 0
. 0
We 0
are 0
looking 0
at 0
a 0
new 0
disease 0
. 0
We 0
are 0
looking 0
at 0
possibly 0
2 0
different 0
viruses 0
, 0
so 0
we 0
really 0
have 0
to 0
cautious 0
in 0
drawing 0
generic 0
and 0
absolute 0
conclusions 0
. 0
The 0
data 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
are 0
relatively 0
firm 0
2 0
days 0
to 0
7 0
days 0
and 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
take 0
more 0
data 0
and 0
analyse 0
them 0
, 0
and 0
these 0
data 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
collected 0
particularly 0
from 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
and 0
particularly 0
in 0
Hanoi 0
, 0
but 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
analytical 0
information 0
perhaps 0
as 0
you 0
describe 0
, 0
but 0
that 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
verified 0
. 0
Now 0
we 0
have 0
10 0
days 0
of 0
the 0
global 0
alert 0
, 0
can 0
we 0
say 0
what 0
of 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
cases 0
known 0
, 0
what 0
the 0
mortality 0
percentage 0
is 0
? 0
A. 0
Dr 0
Julie 0
Hall 0
: 0
It 0
has 0
remained 0
pretty 0
static 0
over 0
the 0
last 0
10 0
days 0
, 0
it 0
's 0
around 0
about 0
4 0
percent 0
mortality 0
rate 0
. 0
So 0
it 0
's 0
quite 0
low 0
and 0
we 0
have 0
n't 0
seen 0
any 0
change 0
in 0
that 0
mortality 0
rate 0
over 0
the 0
10 0
days 0
. 0
In 0
that 0
case 0
is 0
it 0
really 0
such 0
a 0
horrible 0
scourge 0
that 0
's 0
menacing 0
the 0
world 0
, 0
because 0
normally 0
influenza 3
has 0
that 0
kind 0
of 0
mortality 0
rate 0
does 0
n't 0
it 0
? 0
A. 0
Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
I 0
would 0
differ 0
I 0
would 0
say 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
low 0
mortality 0
rate 0
, 0
we 0
want 0
zero 0
mortality 0
rate 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
a 0
4 0
percent 0
mortality 0
in 0
a 0
disease 0
for 0
which 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
yet 0
know 0
the 0
cause 0
. 0
So 0
it 0
's 0
a 0
very 0
serious 0
issue 0
in 0
having 0
a 0
4 0
percent 0
mortality 0
in 0
a 0
disease 0
for 0
which 0
we 0
do 0
n't 0
yet 0
know 0
the 0
cause 0
and 0
which 0
is 0
spreading 0
throughout 0
the 0
world 0
. 0
4 0
percent 0
is 0
a 0
level 0
of 0
mortality 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
equivalent 0
to 0
other 0
viral 0
infections 0
in 0
many 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
world 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
equivalent 0
of 0
what 0
might 0
be 0
occurring 0
with 0
West 3
Nile 0
, 0
it 0
's 0
probably 0
more 0
than 0
what 0
is 0
happening 0
with 0
West 3
Nile 0
in 0
North 0
America 0
. 0
Dr 0
Klaus 0
Stohr 0
: 0
The 0
low 0
mortality 0
rate 0
is 0
perhaps 0
also 0
being 0
contributed 0
to 0
by 0
the 0
enormous 0
clinical 0
efforts 0
taken 0
with 0
those 0
patients 0
. 0
In 0
one 0
hospital 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
there 0
are 0
more 0
than 0
150 0
patients 0
, 0
almost 0
30 0
of 0
whom 0
are 0
in 0
intensive 0
care 0
. 0
Quite 0
a 0
few 0
of 0
them 0
are 0
on 0
ventilators 0
; 0
they 0
would 0
die 0
without 0
mechanical 0
ventilation 0
. 0
The 0
health 0
system 0
is 0
burdened 0
almost 0
to 0
the 0
limit 0
in 0
quite 0
a 0
few 0
of 0
the 0
hospitals 0
, 0
and 0
we 0
of 0
course 0
have 0
to 0
look 0
at 0
the 0
case 0
mortality 0
rate 0
and 0
morbidity 0
but 0
also 0
at 0
the 0
burden 0
on 0
the 0
public 0
health 0
system 0
, 0
which 0
is 0
enormous 0
. 0
Dr 0
David 0
Heymann 0
: 0
And 0
just 0
to 0
put 0
one 0
more 0
thing 0
in 0
perspective 0
. 0
Suppose 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
2 0
diseases 0
occurring 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
, 0
SARS 0
and 0
a 0
disease 0
which 0
causes 0
the 0
same 0
symptoms 0
but 0
is 0
less 0
severe 0
. 0
It 0
my 0
be 0
that 0
this 0
second 0
less 0
severe 0
background 0
disease 0
, 0
caused 0
by 0
another 0
virus 0
, 0
would 0
cause 0
a 0
different 0
case 0
fatality 0
rate 0
. 0
We 0
can 0
only 0
begin 0
to 0
distinguish 0
genuine 0
SARS 4
cases 0
from 0
other 0
less 0
severe 0
diseases 0
having 0
similar 0
initial 0
symptoms 0
when 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
diagnostic 0
test 0
. 0
So 0
we 0
're 0
still 0
far 0
from 0
understanding 0
everything 0
. 0
-LSB- 0
Rather 0
than 0
be 0
critical 0
of 0
changing 0
interpretations 0
and 0
explanations 0
, 0
readers 0
should 0
be 0
reminded 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
new 0
disease 0
process 0
, 0
a 0
truly 0
`` 0
emerging 0
infectious 0

'' 0
about 0
which 0
we 0
have 0
many 0
questions 0
and 0
few 0
definitive 0
answers 0
. 0
We 0
are 0
very 0
early 0
in 0
our 0
identification 0
of 0
this 0
outbreak 0
, 0
the 0
etiology 0
is 0
still 0
unknown 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
epidemiology 0
is 0
still 0
being 0
defined 0
as 0
more 0
cases 0
are 0
identified 0

investigated 0

In 0
our 0
quest 0
for 0
`` 0
transparency 0
'' 0
in 0
investigations 0
, 0
the 0
price 0
we 0
pay 0
is 0
early 0
release 0
of 0
very 0
preliminary 0
findings 0
that 0
with 0
further 0
