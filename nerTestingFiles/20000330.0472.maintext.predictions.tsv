immediately 0
take 0
it 0
out 0

National 0

from 0

were 0

for 0

The 0
child 0
of 0
this 0
mother 0
was 0
also 0
admitted 0
to 0
the 0
second 0
hospital 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
failing 0
to 0
thrive 0
and 0
appeared 0
to 0
have 0
neurological 0
signs 0
. 0
This 0
obviously 0
led 0
to 0
speculation 0
as 0
to 0
whether 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
CJD.Various 0
experts 0
are 0
still 0
thinking 0
about 0
this 0
but 0
at 0
the 0
moment 0
most 0
appear 0
to 0
agree 0
that 0
the 0
illness 0
does 0
not 0
resemble 0
CJD 3
. 0
Obviously 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
problem 0
here 0
in 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
never 0
seen 0
a 0
case 0
of 0
vertical 0
transmission 0
so 0
have 0
no 0
absolute 0
pattern 0
to 0
compare 0
with 0
. 0
Shortly 0
after 0
this 0
the 0
family 0
obtained 0
a 0
court 0
injunction 0
which 0
prohibited 0
anyone 0
from 0
publishing 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
mother 0
or 0
child 0
or 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
any 0
hospital 0
at 0
which 0
they 0
were 0
treated 0
in 0
newspapers 0
on 0
cable 0
TV 0
or 0
on 0
what 0
was 0
called 0
a 0
public 0
computer 0
network 0
. 0
There 0
was 0
considerable 0
debate 0
at 0
the 0
hospital 0
as 0
to 0
whether 0
the 0
7 0
patients 0
should 0
be 0
traced 0
and 0
informed 0
. 0
Expert 0
views 0
were 0
sought 0
from 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
sources 0
and 0
were 0
still 0
being 0
trawled 0
when 0
the 0
Sunday 0
Times 0
decided 0
to 0
run 0
a 0
feature 0
on 0
CJD 3
and 0
speculated 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
a 0
case 0
of 0
vertical 0
transmission 0
. 0
As 0
they 0
could 0
not 0
name 0
the 0
hospital 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
injunction 0
taken 0
out 0
by 0
the 0
family 0
they 0
created 0
a 0
worry 0
for 0
every 0
woman 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
who 0
had 0
recently 0
given 0
birth 0
. 0
At 0
this 0
point 0
I 0
as 0
the 0
Director 0
of 0
Public 0
Health 0
for 0
the 0
region 0
became 0
involved 0
. 0
We 0
had 0
a 0
choice 0
, 0
we 0
could 0
find 0
the 0
7 0
women 0
and 0
tell 0
them 0
their 0
exposure 0
and 0
put 0
out 0
an 0
announcement 0
saying 0
no-one 0
else 0
need 0
worry 0
because 0
the 0
7 0
women 0
had 0
been 0
told 0
. 0
In 0
effect 0
we 0
inflict 0
the 0
problem 0
on 0
these 0
7 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
save 0
everyone 0
else 0
. 0
Advice 0
that 0
we 0
were 0
able 0
to 0
obtain 0
in 0
the 0
short 0
period 0
before 0
we 0
had 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
the 0
media 0
suggested 0
we 0
could 0
cause 0
these 0
women 0
significant 0
harm 0
, 0
both 0
through 0
the 0
anxiety 0
and 0
possible 0
other 0
harm 0
, 0
like 0
reaction 0
of 0
family 0
members 0
, 0
loss 0
of 0
insurability 0
etc. 0
. 0
We 0
had 0
some 0
bad 0
experiences 0
with 0
the 0
early 0
days 0
of 0
HIV 0
where 0
sufferers 0
whose 0
status 0
was 0
accidently 0
discovered 0
and 0
communicated 0
to 0
them 0
without 0
warning 0
were 0
done 0
real 0
harm 0
and 0
some 0
committed 0
suicide 0
. 0
The 0
possibility 0
of 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
women 0
killing 0
themselves 0
because 0
we 0
had 0
forced 0
this 0
information 0
about 0
possible 0
exposure 0
to 0
nvCJD 0
on 0
them 0
seemed 0
worth 0
avoiding 0
if 0
we 0
could 0
. 0
I 0
referred 0
to 0
the 0
ethical 0
principle 0
, 0
` 0
first 0
do 0
no 0
harm 0
' 0
. 0
We 0
therefore 0
went 0
for 0
a 0
different 0
option 0
, 0
aiming 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
information 0
available 0
to 0
anyone 0
who 0
wished 0
to 0
know 0
but 0
giving 0
patients 0
the 0
choice 0
of 0
knowing 0
their 0
particular 0
status 0
. 0
We 0
set 0
up 0
a 0
phone 0
line 0
with 0
the 0
following 0
advice 0
algorithm 0
. 0
If 0
caller 0
not 0
from 0
George 0
Elliot 0
tell 0
not 0
to 0
worry 0
. 0
If 0
from 0
George 0
Elliot 0
and 0
not 0
in 0
the 0
relevant 0
period 0
, 0
tell 0
them 0
not 0
to 0
worry 0
. 0
If 0
in 0
this 0
period 0
and 0
hospital 0
then 0
issue 0
special 0
number 0
for 0
George 0
Elliot 0
which 0
connects 0
to 0
counsellors 0
and 0
a 0
team 0
who 0
will 0
visit 0
to 0
discuss 0
risk 0
. 0
We 0
also 0
discussed 0
the 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
injunction 0
with 0
the 0
judge 0
and 0
other 0
legal 0
advisors 0
. 0
Later 0
in 0
the 0
week 0
the 0
injunction 0
was 0
modified 0
to 0
permit 0
naming 0
George 0
Elliot 0
Hospital 0
, 0
hence 0
I 0
can 0
name 0
it 0
here 0
but 0
not 0
name 0
the 0
second 0
hospital 0
which 0
made 0
the 0
vCJD 0
diagnosis 0
. 0
During 0
the 0
week 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
over 0
500 0
calls 0
to 0
the 0
2 0
lines 0
and 0
6 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
7 0
women 0
have 0
eventually 0
decided 0
that 0
they 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
their 0
status 0
. 0
There 0
was 0
an 0
enormous 0
amount 0
of 0
press 0
coverage 0
, 0
much 0
of 0
it 0
rubbish 0
but 0
we 0
were 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
some 0
sensible 0
debate 0
on 0
the 0
TV 0
and 0
radio 0
in 0
which 0
our 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
issues 0
was 0
accepted 0
. 0
Feedback 0
from 0
samples 0
of 0
women 0
who 0
came 0
forward 0
for 0
advice 0
was 0
they 0
appreciated 0
the 0
method 0
we 0
had 0
used 0
and 0
supported 0
the 0
approach 0
. 0
I 0
think 0
the 0
case 0
raises 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
difficult 0
issues 0
, 0
which 0
were 0
made 0
more 0
complex 0
by 0
the 0
family 0
taking 0
out 0
their 0
injunction 0
. 0
The 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
injunction 0
prevented 0
me 0
from 0
e-mailing 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
hospital 0
to 0
all 0
our 0
General 0
Practitioners 0
because 0
in 0
the 0
British 0
system 0
GPs 0
contract 0
independently 0
with 0
the 0
NHS 0
and 0
are 0
therefore 0
technically 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
public 0
. 0
Although 0
the 0
words 0
` 0
public 0
computer 0
network 0
' 0
were 0
intended 0
to 0
catch 0
the 0
internet 0
they 0
actually 0
got 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
normal 0
public 0
health 0
work 0
. 0
If 0
this 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
case 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
rapidly 0
transmissible 0
disease 0
was 0
the 0
issue 0
I 0
would 0
have 0
ignored 0
the 0
injunction 0
and 0
told 0
the 0
GPs 0
anyway 0
, 0
but 0
in 0
doing 0
so 0
I 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
in 0
contempt 0
of 0
court 0
and 0
could 0
in 0
theory 0
have 0
been 0
jailed 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
happy 0
to 0
discuss 0
the 0
various 0
technical 0
and 0
ethical 0
issues 0
with 0
anyone 0
interested 0
. 0
I 0
hope 0
that 0
this 0
sets 0
out 0
enough 0
of 0
what 0
we 0
faced 0
and 0
how 0
we 0
determined 0
our 0
action 0
to 0
make 0
constructive 0
debate 0
possible 0
. 0
I 0
appreciate 0
that 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
report 0
to 0
your 0
journal 0
was 0
so 0
garbled 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
difficult 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
was 0
happening 0
and 0
it 0
did 0
not 0
bear 0
much 0
relation 0
to 0
things 0
I 0
actually 0
and 0
what 0
we 0
did 0
. 0
Finally 0
I 0
find 0
it 0
unfortunate 0
that 0
Charles 0
Calisher 0
should 0
immediately 0
resort 0
to 0
wild 0
flaming 0
of 0
me 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
had 0
to 0
handle 0
this 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
insulting 0
to 0
assume 0
that 0
we 0
had 0
sought 0
to 0
cover 0
this 0
up 0
through 0
legal 0
mechanisms 0
nor 0
do 0
I 0
agree 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
appropriate 0
to 0
drag 0
unsuspecting 0
women 0
into 0
a 0
potentially 0
life 0
threatening 0
nightmare 0
order 0
to 0
somehow 0
show 0
up 0
insurance 0
companies 0

is 0
not 0
