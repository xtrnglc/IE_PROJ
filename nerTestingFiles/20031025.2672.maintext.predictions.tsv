I 0
am 0
responding 0
-RSB- 0
to 0
the 0
query 0
about 0
why 0
no 0
Marines 0
were 0
using 0
bednets 0
while 0
in 0
Liberia 0
. 0
Bednet 0
use 0
is 0
a 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
standard 0

The 0
Marines 0
deploying 0
to 0
Liberia 0
had 0
bednets 0
back 0
on 0
their 0
ship 0
. 0
The 0
decision 0
not 0
to 0
go 0
ashore 0
with 0
bednets 0
was 0
multifactorial 0
: 0
1 0
. 0
Operational 0

essentially 0
fast 0

fast 0

difficult 0
. 0
The 0
initial 0
plan 0
was 0
only 0
for 0
1-3 0
nights 0
, 0
not 0
10-12 0
nights 0

. 0
Marines 0
were 0
staying 0
in 0
an 0

not 0
the 0

A 0
review 0
of 0
the 0
situation 0
leading 0
to 0
this 0
outbreak 0
addressed 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
bednet 0
use 0
as 0
a 0
significant 0
factor 0
in 0
development 0
of 0

in 0
the 0

-LSB- 0
Impregnated 0
bednets 0
have 0
a 0
protective 0
efficacy 0
of 0
around 0
50 0
percent 0
if 0
used 0
properly 0
. 0
The 0
reason 0
for 0
not 0
finding 0
higher 0
efficacy 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
net 0
provides 0
protection 0
only 0
while 0
the 0
individual 0
is 0
sleeping 0
under 0
it 0
. 0
Thus 0
there 0
is 0
exposure 0
to 0
mosquitoes 0
early 0
in 0
the 0
morning 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
evening 0
before 0
going 0
to 0
bed 0
, 0
and 0
soldiers 0
on 0
night 0
duty 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
protected 0
. 0
The 0
use 0
of 0
nets 0
in 0
the 0
given 0
situation 0
would 0
therefore 0
have 0
reduced 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
cases 0
, 0
but 0
probably 0
by 0
less 0
than 0
half 0
. 0
Under 0
intense 0
transmission 0
as 0
in 0
this 0
situation 0
, 0
chemoprophylaxis 0
provides 0
better 0
protection 0
than 0
impregnated 0
bednets 0
. 0

But 0
another 0
response 0
, 0
from 0
a 0
former 0
Marine 0
, 0
highlights 0
the 0
problem 0
of 0
poor 0
compliance 0
with 0
prophylaxis 0
among 0
the 0
military 0
. 0
In 0
such 0
circumstances 0
, 0
any 0
reduction 0
in 0
illness 0
among 0
active 0
duty 0
troops 0
provided 0
by 0
impregnated 0
bednets 0
is 0
operationally 0
important 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
good 0
to 0
hear 0
that 0
the 0
experience 0
of 0
this 0
outbreak 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
immediate 0
modification 0
of 0
bednet 0
design 0
. 0
I 0
suppose 0
neither 0
Marines 0
nor 0
Sailors 0
sleep 0
in 0
hammocks 0
any 0
more 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
jungle 0
hammock 0
with 0
integral 0
bednet 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
practical 0
design 0
, 0
& 0
could 0
be 0
readily 0
rigged 0
inside 0
buildings 0
on 0
the 0
light 0
dismountable 0
tubing 0
frames 0
used 0
for 0
garden 0
hammocks 0
, 0
probably 0
no 0
heavier 0
in 0
total 0
weight 0
than 0
camp 0
cots 0
