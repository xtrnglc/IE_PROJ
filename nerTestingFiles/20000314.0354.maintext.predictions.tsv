without 0

of 0

reason 0

chosen 0

as 0

: 0
1 0
. 0
Poison 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
taken 0
by 0
all 0
the 0
monkeys 0
in 0
sufficient 0
quantity 0
to 0
preclude 0
sub-lethal 0
dosing 0
since 0
they 0
are 0
highly 0
neophobic 0

would 0
learn 0
the 0
effects 0
of 0
eating 0
the 0
poisoned 0
food 0
from 0
their 0
sick 0
and 0
dying 0
conspecifics 0

Moreover 0
, 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
risk 0
the 0
bears 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
exhibit 0
would 0
consume 0
the 0
poison 0
also 0
. 0
To 0
dart 0
and 0
subsequently 0
administer 0
a 0
lethal 0
injection 0
was 0
considered 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
major 0
welfare 0
issue 0
and 0
technically 0
impossible 0
. 0
Darted 0
monkeys 0
falling 0
20 0
meters 0
to 0
the 0
ground 0
would 0
suffer 0
horrific 0
injuries 0
, 0
and 0
then 0
be 0
required 0
to 0
be 0
injected 0
. 0

velocity 0

dart 0
required 0
to 0
reach 0
the 0
monkeys 0
in 0
the 0
tops 0
of 0

potentially 0
kill 0
them 0

effects 0
