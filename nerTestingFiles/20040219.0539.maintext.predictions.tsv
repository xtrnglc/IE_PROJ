the 0
Russian 0
Federation 0
, 0
Yuriy 0
Zolotov 0

altogether 0
in 0

are 0
about 0
1100 0

A 0
cattle 0
graveyard 0
in 0
Tobolsk 0
needs 0
special 0
attention 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
located 0
on 0
the 0
banks 0
of 0
the 0
Irtish 0
river 0
, 0
and 0
if 0
flooding 0
occurs 0
, 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
high 0
risk 0
of 0
the 0
river 0
becoming 0
infected 0
with 0
anthrax 3

Today 0
the 0

is 0
separated 0
from 0

by 0
50 0

today 0
this 0

I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
provide 0
some 0
comments 0
about 0
the 0
message 0
you 0
sent 0
me 0
regarding 0
anthrax 3
in 0
the 0
Ural 0
region 0
. 0
Firstly 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
point 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
Ural 0
Federal 0
region 0
is 0
approximately 0
1.8 0
million 0
square 0
km 0
in 0
area 0
, 0
with 0
a 0
human 0
population 0
of 0
about 0
12.5 0
million 0
. 0
The 0
region 0
consists 0
of 0
Kurgan 0
, 0
Sverdlovsk 0
, 0
Tumen 0
, 0
Chelyabinsk 0
, 0
Yamalo-Nenetskaya 0
, 0
and 0
Hanti-Mansiyskaya 0
national 0
districts 0
. 0
The 0
entire 0
region 0
-LRB- 0
north 0
to 0
south 0
-RRB- 0
has 0
a 0
history 0
of 0
anthrax 3
, 0
and 0
therefore 0
the 0
discovery 0
of 0
numerous 0
anthrax 3
sites 0
should 0
not 0
come 0
as 0
a 0
surprise 0
-LRB- 0
in 0
Russia 0
, 0
places 0
with 0
any 0
history 0
of 0
anthrax 3
are 0
permanently 0
labelled 0
as 0
` 0
anthrax 3
sites 0
' 0
-RRB- 0
. 0
I 0
personally 0
know 0
the 0
location 0
of 0
2086 0
such 0
sites 0
in 0
the 0
Ural 0
region 0
. 0
At 0
4 0
of 0
these 0
sites 0
, 0
cases 0
of 0
animals 0
being 0
infected 0
with 0
anthrax 3
were 0
recorded 0
between 0
1991 0
and 0
2000 0
. 0
In 0
reality 0
, 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
cattle 0
gravesites 0
is 0
much 0
higher 0
, 0
as 0
there 0
may 0
be 0
several 0
such 0
gravesites 0
at 0
any 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
anthrax 3
sites 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
hard 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
positively 0
identified 0
anthrax 3
spores 4
in 0
these 0
gravesites 0
-- 0
as 0
there 0
have 0
never 0
been 0
such 0
investigations 0
into 0
these 0
sites 0
. 0
The 0
Tobolski 0
gravesite 0
is 0
peculiar 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
banks 0
of 0
the 0
Irtish 0
river 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
familiar 0
with 0
many 0
such 0
gravesites 0
on 0
the 0
banks 0
of 0
various 0
rivers 0
and 0
even 0
at 0
the 0
bottom 0
of 0
artificial 0
water 0
reservoirs 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
my 0
field 0
studies 0
show 0
that 0
such 0
gravesites 0
do 0
not 0
pose 0
any 0
serious 0
epidemiological 0
concern 0
. 0
The 0
Tobolski 0
gravesite 0
is 0
the 0
result 0
of 0
activity 0
at 0
a 0
nearby 0
factory 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
production 0
of 0
veterinary 0
prophylactic 0
drugs 0
, 0
including 0
vaccines 0
against 0
anthrax 3
. 0
Unfortunately 0
despite 0
sealing 0
off 0
the 0
toxic 0
waste 0
storage 0
facility 0
with 0
concrete 0
, 0
which 0
provides 0
isolation 0
from 0
the 0
surrounding 0
environment 0
, 0
the 0
factory 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
any 0
resources 0
for 0
the 0
radical 0
disinfection 0
of 0
the 0
waste 0
. 0
I 0
hope 0
that 0
my 0

what 0

While 0
such 0
places 0
are 0
commonly 0
regarded 0
as 0
risk 0
sites 0

the 0
reality 0
is 0
more 0
of 0
uncertainty 0

ignorance 0

While 0
some 0
sites 0

have 0
viable 0

significant 0
numbers 0

what 0
determines 0

its 0

totally 0

Logically 0
it 0
must 0
depend 0
on 0
soil 0

also 0

on 0
whether 0
necropsies 0

done 0
on 0
the 0
affected 0

before 0

and 0

unopened 0
carcasses 0
will 0
rapidly 0
kill 0
the 0
vegetative 0
cells 0
as 0
the 0
pH 0
falls 0
. 0
Burning 0
and 0
then 0
burial 0
of 0
the 0
ashes 0
results 0
in 0
essentially 0
zero 0
risk 0
. 0
And 0
even 0
with 0
sites 0
that 0
have 0
spores 0
, 0
repeated 0
sampling 0
over 0
the 0
years 0
has 0
shown 0
some 0
sites 0
becoming 0
` 0
apathogenic 0
' 0
from 0
plasmid 0
loss 0
. 0
Examination 0
of 0
such 0
sites 0
is 0
needed 0
, 0
if 0
only 0
to 0
rule 0
out 0
those 0
